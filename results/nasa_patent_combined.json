      "A miniature satellite, or CubeSat, has deployable solar arrays and/or body mounted solar cells to generate adequate electrical power to meet mission power requirements. The CubeSats internal components dissipate heat. In order to maintain the component temperatures within allowable flight limits, the waste heat needs to be radiated from its exterior to deep space. Depending on the orbit parameters, one or more of the exterior surfaces could be exposed to sunlight, planet albedo (reflection of solar radiation from Earth), or infrared radiative flux. Additionally, lithium ion batteries, often used on CubeSats, are required to be above 0 C during charging. Conventionally, a combination of radiator thermal coatings, multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets, and active heater control are used to meet component thermal requirements, which are all relatively expensive. Furthermore, MLI blankets not only increase the volume of the CubeSat, but also increase the risk of entanglement during solar array deployment. The SiOx Coated Aluminized Polyimide Film Radiator Coating regulates temperature for CubeSats without these drawbacks.",

      "Understanding the composition of planetary surfaces is crucial for advancing space exploration and preparing for future human missions to the Moon and Mars. NASA’s proposed International Mars Ice Mapping (I-MIM) mission aims to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to identify near-surface ice deposits on Mars, which could serve as a vital resource for future explorers. To support this effort, scientists must first determine how radar signals interact with the diverse materials found on these planetary bodies, such as rock, regolith, and buried ice. An understanding of these interactions is critical to designing specialized SARs for such missions, as well as to determining their detection capabilities in specific environments. Traditional methods of analyzing such materials have provided valuable insights, but they often lack the ability to assess the 3-D electromagnetic (EM) properties of rock and soil, which are critical for improving radar-based detection capabilities. Furthermore, existing techniques require regularly shaped samples (e.g., rectangles). Martian and other planetary rock samples brought back to Earth are precious and cannot be altered, eliminating these techniques as an option. \n\nRecognizing this challenge, a team of engineers and scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (<span class=\"highlight\">GSFC</span>) have developed an advanced laboratory-based system for measuring the dielectric and magnetic properties of arbitrarily shaped samples with high accuracy.",

      "Micro Pulse LiDAR (MPL) instruments – first developed in the early 1990s by a NASA scientist – are compact, eye-safe elastic-backscatter LiDARs deployable at remote locations. A federated ground network of MPLs compose the NASA MPL Network (MPLNET), which provides continuous aerosol and cloud profiling data around the globe. However, using MPLs – especially for aerosol research – in the near range (0-6 km) requires a time consuming, laborious overlap calibration process to quantify and correct the region where the emitted laser beam and detector field of view do not fully overlap. At close ranges, this overlap is often incomplete, leading to reduced signal accuracy. Accurate characterization and correction of this function are vital for precise data, especially for near-surface atmospheric features.\n\nIn response to this challenge, engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center developed the Wide Field Receiver (WFR) Calibration Device for MPLs. This auxiliary receiver has a broad field of view compared to the standard MPL receiver, allowing it to capture more scattered light from the atmosphere, including regions where the standard receiver’s overlap is complete. By comparing data from both standard and this NASA wide field of view receiver, users can accurately determine the overlap function and apply necessary corrections to MPL data, all with reduced time and effort relative to conventional techniques.",

      "Fiber optic sensing systems (FOSS) have advantages over conventional sensors including lighter weight, smaller size, improved reliability, and higher accuracy. To date, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) has perhaps been the most popular fiber optic sensing method. Drawbacks of WDM exist, however, including the importance of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor locations, need for each sensor to have a unique wavelength, and limited number of sensors that can occupy any one data channel (~10). As a result, NASA has focused on OFDR, an alternative FBG interrogation technique based on laser interferometry. OFDR provides advantages over WDM, most notably higher spatial density (up to 1000 FBGs can be multiplexed into a single fiber), and reduced cost per sensor. \n\nDuring development of an OFDR-based FOSS system, cost and performance-based limitations of traditional excitation sources led NASA to develop a novel, wavelength-swept, solid-state laser tailored to this application.",

Many materials contain gasses that are trapped on or within the surface that, when in vacuum, will escape the host material over time - a process known as outgassing. The extent of outgassing is a function of the material, temperature, and the vacuum level present. To address outgassing issues in spacecraft, NASA has historically used zeolite based molecular adsorbers in spacecraft and instruments to collect and retain outgassed molecular effluent emanating from potting compounds, epoxies, tapes, lubricants, and other spacecraft materials, protecting critical, contamination sensitive, surfaces. Uncontrolled, molecular contamination can cause significant degradation of instrument performance, thermal control properties, solar array efficiency, optical surfaces, laser systems, detectors, cryogenic instruments, and high powered electronics. In an effort to simplify previously flown complex zeolite coated cordierite molecular adsorber puck systems, such as those flown on Hubble Space Telescope (HST), a portfolio of easily produced and applied molecular adsorber coatings have been developed.",

      "Current methods for generating water droplets often require a tradeoff between droplet size and velocity. Small, atomized droplets can be accelerated to high speeds, while larger droplets tend to move slowly. This technology offers the best of both worlds: generating relatively large water droplets (up to 100 micrometer diameter) at high velocity (up to 115 m/s). The droplet generator was developed at NASA Glenn Research Center to provide a reliable way to evaluate icing effects and water's impact on <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> components during flight tests and wind tunnel studies. By precisely controlling droplet size and speed, the technology ensures repeatable water droplet impact conditions for sensor calibration and materials testing. For icing studies, this technology solves challenges related to splashing, pooling, and other challenges that can impact the accuracy of hot wire anemometer probes.  And unlike other sprayers which either atomize droplets or fail to achieve high velocity with large droplets, this novel design propels intact, well-defined droplets for more controlled experiments.

However, metal AM exhibits high complexity compared to conventionally manufactured parts (e.g., point-by-point deviations in grain structure, material properties, and defect conditions). These complexities make it difficult to ensure accuracy and detectability of critical defects via nondestructive evaluation (NDE). As a result, despite their promise, few metal AM parts have made their way into commercial use for safety-critical applications (<span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span>, medical, etc.). \n\nX-Ray Computed Tomography (X-Ray CT) has become the gold standard for volumetric characterization of metal AM components. However, X-Ray CT can have defect detection measurement uncertainty, particularly for porosity (the most prominent safety-critical defect in metal AM). A recent study of different labs performing X-Ray CT-based inspection of metal AM parts found that, across 10 different facilities, maximum pore size measured varied by a factor of 4.5 and bulk porosity estimated varied by over a factor of 7! Clearly, a new highly accurate and reliable technique is required that can help develop and can improve the accuracy and reliability of part-specific X-ray CT NDE to speed up certification, enabling industry to realize the advantages of metal AM components for safety-critical applications.",

The extreme sensitivity of PACE’s instrumentation eliminates traditional solutions, like slip rings, which degrade over time due to repeated discharges. These discharges not only risk damaging critical components but could also compromise the accuracy of mission data. To protect the sensitive instruments and ensure reliable operation, a novel method was needed to mitigate surface charging. \n\nInnovators at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center have developed a novel self-adjusting gap (SAG) system for mitigating and monitoring surface charge. The SAG system is a revolutionary approach to non-conductive bearings. Not only is the system capable of mitigating discharge related risks, but also acts a sensor to measure charging on isolated components. It is self-adjusting, passive, robust, and more precisely controllable than existing technologies.",

      "Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a new method for making small diameter, high-grade Nickel Titanium (NiTi) ball bearings that set a new standard for precision performance in the bearing field. Using non-corrosive NiTi alloy instead of steel is an inexpensive way to increase the load capability and reduce the weight of a ball bearing. It has been difficult, however, to produce balls less than 0.375\" in diameter using the standard baseline 60NiTi alloy. To address this challenge, Glenn innovators have created a new, more advanced alloy consisting of NiTi and Hafnium (Hf) that can produce high-quality ball bearings of any size, but most notably less than 0.25\" in diameter. Glenn's NiTi-Hf ball bearings are superior to any previously used alloy or steel. They are corrosion-resistant, shockproof, and have been rated at a grade 10 or higher on the Annular Bearing Engineering Committee (ABEC) scale (an industry-accepted tolerance standard for bearings). Thanks to their high strength and Rockwell hardness (HRC 58-60), these customizable ball bearings will facilitate new high-speed precision applications in a broad range of industries, including <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span>, automotive, industrial, medical, and more.",

However, they typically have poor thermal conductivity, which limits their use to applications where heat transfer is not required.

      "As NASA plans for manned missions to Mars, efforts are being made to identify technologies that must be improved to make such trips feasible. Valves have been identified as one technology in need of improvement – on the voyage to Mars, propellants and other stored materials will leak through seals in the lines, tanks, and valves. For example, traditional valve technologies are projected to result in a loss of 17 tons of hydrogen during a 6-year manned trip to Mars. Thus, to make a Mars mission (or other long duration manned space missions) feasible, cryogenic valve leakage rates must be reduced by several orders of magnitude. \n\nAfter identifying this need, engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center set out to develop a solution. The result is NASA’s self-aligning poppet for low leakage valves – a seat alignment technology that eliminates the need to precisely control interfaces between poppet sealing surfaces and the valve seat seal. Instead, the seat and poppet self-align, ensuring the poppet is always centered, parallel to the seat, and perpendicular to the actuator line of action. Testing has shown that NASA’s self-aligning poppet reduces leakage in <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> cryogenic valves by three orders of magnitude.",

The novel sensor design also quells the deleterious effects of thermal expansion mismatch between the thermal protection system (TPS) material comprised in the spacecraft’s outer shell, and the embedded thin film sensors’ component materials. \n\nCurrent methods that capture temperature data from the surface of a reentering spacecraft typically rely upon the use of low frequency thermocouples embedded in the spacecraft’s TPS and are limited to ~700 F.

      "Innovators at NASA Johnson Space Center have developed a battery testing technology called ThermoArc that uses a plasma arc to drive a Li-ion battery cell into thermal runaway (TR) by inducing a localized short circuit. The short circuit is created when the plasma arc breaches the cell and melts a small section of the internal separator causing the anode and cathode to come into contact. This \"short\" yields rapid heat generation that, if not contained, can potentially cause a fire or explosion.\n \nThis situation becomes especially dangerous if a single cell’s TR event propagates to other cells within a battery pack, such as those used commercially in <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> and electric vehicles. Therefore, various testing methodologies have been adopted by battery manufacturers to study TR and the results, and thereby improve TR containment.\n \nThermoArc presents a method that uses a plasma arc to deliver thermal energy to heat up only a small area of a Li-ion battery cell to trigger a TR event. This method ensures that the total heat applied is minimal and does not affect the cell’s thermal properties nor does it make significant electrical or mechanical alterations to the cell. Additionally, ThermoArc technology can be implemented to initiate hundreds of repeatable Li-ion battery cell TR tests significantly cheaper than other TR testing method-ologies given that the only consumables are inexpensive electrodes.",

Ames Research Center has developed an alternative approach to forming radiation-reflecting materials by using the ordered structures that are found in nature to make materials that can be used to reflect radiation called Biologically-Inspired Radiation-Reflecting Ablator (BIRRA).",

Once airborne, the wing would be pivoted to the sweep angle that provides the best aerodynamic performance and noise abatement at the current speed. During cruise, both speed and sweep angles could be adjusted accordingly. Before final approach, the wing would again be rotated to the perpendicular position in order to improve the aircraft's low-speed performance.

These superelastic materials can withstand tremendous loads and stresses without permanent deformation or denting. At the same time, the nickel-titanium alloy is immune to corrosion and rust, unlike mechanical components made from iron or steel. In addition, the material does not chemically degrade or break down lubricants, a common problem with existing bearing materials. These materials are best suited for oil lubricated rolling and sliding contact applications requiring superior and intrinsic corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, and non-magnetic properties.",

      "NASA has developed a novel method to render visible the density changes in air that cause a refractive index change by an airborne vehicle. These density changes include shock waves, vortices, engine exhaust, and wakes. The determination of location and strength of shockwaves and vortices is fundamental to understanding the flow around an aircraft. These features are strong enough to affect the environment that the vehicle inhabits: for example, they can cause drag and/or produce undesirable noise. The researcher must be able to predict and mitigate the effects of these flow features.  This invention is a robust visualization technique that will permit the measurement of the strengths and positions of shock waves caused by supersonic vehicles. The technique is applicable to all flight regimes, however, and can be used for visualizing tip vortices, engine exhaust plumes.",

To alleviate these problems, i-DME can automatically playback very large data sets to find time points of interest where user-set performance criteria for detection and isolation are violated.  i-DME modifies the diagnostic model through its abstract representation, diagnostic matrix (D-matrix). The types of modifications are procedures ranging from modifying 0s and 1s in the D-matrix adding/removing the rows/columns, or modifying test/wrapper logic used to determine test results.

The USW process decouples the heating, stirring, and forging elements found in the friction stir welding process allowing for independent control of each process element and, ultimately, greater process control and repeatability.

Aerodynamic flow over an unfilled cavity typically exhibits strongly unsteady behavior that is a source of aeroacoustic noise. Conventional leading-edge slat devices for high lift are a good example of such geometric and flow conditions and are a prominent source of airframe noise. Experimental and computational results have shown that a slat-cove filler device could significantly reduce the noise produced by slat structures without aerodynamic penalty. The proposed structural concept will enable autonomous achievement of the desired deployed shape. The design will facilitate a clean cruise configuration with minimal weight addition to the aircraft.

Traditionally, when a satellite transmits to another satellite or a ground station, a separate terminal with a corresponding antenna is needed for each radio frequency band.  Equipment becomes more complex as frequencies get higher. At the higher bands, large heat sinks are needed to dissipate the waste heat. Now, however, innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have successfully developed a method using a single laser beam to combine and transmit - all in one unit - multiple microwave bands with different modulation formats and bandwidths. This breakthrough benefits space communication systems in important ways, including reduced size, weight, and complexity, with consequent savings in cost.

PCBs generate heat while functioning. In a vacuum, this heat can only dissipate through conduction and radiation. Ensuring efficient heat rejection requires strong thermal conductivity between the PCB and its enclosure. However, if the enclosure's temperature drops too low – due to environmental conditions, idle processors, or other factors – excessive heat rejection can cause the PCB to fail. Currently, maintaining PCBs above their minimum operating temperature of around -20C demands significant energy and mass (e.g., batteries).\n\nIn response to this challenge, engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) have developed a PCB-mounted thermal switch that allows the PCB to toggle between being “thermally mounted” (heat-dissipating) and “thermally unmounted” (heat-conserving) to the electronics enclosure, depending on temperature conditions. This switch fits easily onto a PCB and is completely passive, eliminating the need for battery power to maintain the PCB within its operating temperature range.",

Innovators at NASA’s Glenn Research Center developed an easily implementable enhancement to existing DC bus emulators that overcome these limitations.\n\nThe inspiration for this technology arose because NASA designs power systems for a variety of loads, from spacecraft and aircraft to future lunar outputs. The busses that power these loads may include simple, individual DC-to-DC power converters, or complex, integrated systems, such as robots, propulsors, refueling equipment, and habitation hardware. Each load and each system are key to an application’s function, making them critical to assess. \n\nHowever, using COTS DC loads it is not possible to fully, dynamically replicate power systems, subsystems, or individual loads on a small-signal basis. Further, this replication method is costly and time-consuming because hardware copies are needed to recreate each individual load that will be assessed in a DC microgrid. In contrast, using a mixture of representative filters, a Pulsed Width Modulator (PWM) dithering technique, and COTS loads, this technology provides a collaborative way to integrate individual, sub-system, and entire power systems loads.",

The design also provides for operation on a more linear portion of the spring's force deflection curve, yielding better feedback to the user.\n\nPhysical hand controllers, such as translational and rotational controllers, use a non-circumferential scissor spring arrangement to return the control stick to a neutral position, but the linear response of a typical scissor spring arrangement can reduce a user’s sense of control by allowing slack between deflections.\n\nThis innovation’s design is driven by a spring mechanism whereby an expansion spring is looped around the channeled circumference of two rounded pivoting blades whose setup can be tuned to allow varying spring tension. This allows the user enhanced control stick sensitivity while operating drive systems, industrial automation, measuring technology, mobile machinery, and gaming systems. \n\nThis technology is currently implemented on NASA’s Orion Spacecraft training simulators using three-axis hand controllers.",

Testing under conditions representative of actual-use environments including large temperature differences is also provided.  The test data are presented in terms of effective thermal conductivity and heat flux.  \nIn today's world, efficient, low-maintenance, low-temperature refrigeration is taking a more significant role, from the food industry, transportation, and medical applications to commercial buildings, energy, and space exploration. Worldwide, various regulations require that commercially available insulation materials are tested and evaluated by an accepted methodology.

      "An innovation from NASA's Glenn Research Center increases the efficiency and versatility of fuel cell stacks for power generation. When there is a large increase in the power demand from a fuel cell system, the voltage of the fuel cell system decreases, sometimes below the lowest acceptable threshold. To meet the requirements of a fuel cell system, engineers have typically added direct-current-to-direct-current (DC-to-DC) converters that boost the voltage produced at the ends of the fuel cell stack or added additional fuel cell systems to manage the increased power demand. However, adding DC-to-DC converters or additional fuel cell systems increases cost, reduces efficiency, and adds both mass and volume. NASA's innovative technique features multiple power points that connect different numbers of cells in an electrical series to a device connected to the fuel cell system, allowing the fuel cell system to maintain the desired voltage to the device under very large electrical power demand changes. This capability eliminates DC-to-DC converter electronics, thereby reducing cost and simplifying the system.",

In order to achieve a high energy output radiation that matches the spectroscopic features of desired measurement objectives, this CW laser source was developed to injection seed and control the wavelength of a high energy laser. NASA's CW laser source can provide multiple wavelengths suitable for single and multi-pulsed lasers using a low-power radiation source. This results in a compact, lightweight, and low power consumption injection seeder that is suitable for airborne and space-borne applications including, but not limited to Lidar applications, atmospheric observation instruments, and optical signal generators.",

      "Innovators at the NASA Glenn Research Center have developed the Vortex Radiometer (VR), an early-warning system for communication antennas that identifies atmospheric noise before it reaches the antenna and then optimizes mitigation strategies. Communication links are subject to atmospheric effects that reduce the signal power received at the antenna (i.e., a fade). If the atmospheric losses are too high, the signal level could drop below the minimum measurable power of the receiver, causing data loss across the communication link. Previous attempts to forewarn fading using predictive algorithms have yielded sub-optimal results largely because they rely on real-time performance data from the communications link itself, meaning they have very little time to respond. By contrast, NASA's VR constantly senses incoming noise, which allows real-time measurement and characterization of fading and enables maximization of data throughput.",

This non-destructive evaluation system is based on an ultrasonic contact scanner enclosed in an insulated vessel placed inside of the autoclave. The system actively scans for any defects that may form in composites during the cure process and tracks movement of defects originating during layup or cure. Typically, non-destructive evaluation of composites, by ultrasound or other means, is conducted either before or after the cure process, but many defects vanish and form during cure. NASA's in-situ cure monitoring system, by contrast, provides real-time monitoring of defect formation and movement during cure.

The drive for energy efficiency in power generation and propulsion places the development of high-performance materials at the forefront of materials science. Turbine engine efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions are directly related to engine operating temperature.

Therefore, increased performance in aircraft engines and land-based power generators requires the development of new high-temperature structural materials that are resistant to creep.

Simple-hinged flaps are less complex, and an ideal choice for low-drag cruise efficiency. However, simple-hinged flaps require high flap deflections to achieve lift comparable to Fowler flaps. These flap deflections cause severe  adverse pressure gradients, which generate flow separation that is difficult to control.\n\nIn response to these challenges, NASA developed the High Efficiency Low Power (HELP) active flow control (AFC) system. This simple, elegant invention can control flow separation resulting from the high flap deflections required by simple-hinged flap systems – making such flaps a viable option for aircraft designers.

      "Inflatable and deployable beams and masts such as solar sail supports used in space missions are often made of polymer composites and may be stored for one to two years in space before deployment. While stored, these polymer composites degrade on a molecular level, which can limit the ability of the beams to unfurl properly, reducing performance or even failing to unfurl. Researchers at NASAs Langley Research Center developed a fiber-reinforced polymer composite to reduce the effect of viscoelastic creep and prolong the molecular integrity of polymer-based beams over time. NASAs polymer composite technology augments the molecular structure of the resin matrix by incorporating secondary additives and adjusting the composite architecture. Test results show that the new material reduces relaxation in the modified-molecular structure to as low as 5% from the initial modulus after two years. This compares to 49% relaxation after one year for the state-of-the-art, commercially available options.",

NASA Ames has developed a novel solid state, CO2 sensor configured for sensitive detection of CO2  having a concentration within the range of about 100 Parts Per Million (ppm) and 10,000 ppm in both dry conditions and high humidity conditions. The composite sensing material comprises Oxidized Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (O-MWCNT) and a metal oxide.

This is a problem because the current sensor cannot determine the sign (+/-) of the signal  frequencies, resulting in false measurements of range and velocity. NASA has developed an operational prototype (TRL 6) of the method and algorithm that works with the receiver to correct the problem.

NASA's Affordable Vehicle Avionics (AVA) technology offers access to space for small-payload SLV operators with an ability to provide dedicated launch to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), when and where they need.

TASAR features a cockpit automation system that monitors for potential flight trajectory improvements and displays them to the pilot. These wind-optimized flight trajectory changes are pre-cleared of potential conflicts with other known airplane traffic, weather hazards, and airspace restrictions. The objective of TASAR is to improve the process in which pilots request flight path and altitude modifications due to changing flight conditions. Changes may be made to reduce flight time, increase fuel efficiency, or improve some other flight attribute desired by the operator. Currently pilots make such requests to ATC with limited awareness of what is happening around them. Consequently, some of these requests will be denied resulting in no flight improvements and an unnecessary workload increase for both pilots and ATC. The TASAR technology provides pilots with recommended flight path and altitude improvements that are more likely to be approved by ATC.",

By optimizing wavelengths used for QKD photon and data transmission (wave division), a focusing lens can be used to create a diffraction pattern that focuses QKD photons on the core and the higher energy signal onto the 1st cladding (spatial division). The SAW method enables de-multiplexing of simultaneously transmitted optical data and built-in photonic QKD encryption keys. The method was developed by NASA to send and receive encryption keys using weak coherent pulsed light rather than entangled photons; it can be applied to the encryption of any free space optical communications.",

Previous kite-based systems required active control, either through manual commands sent via radio control or autonomous adjustments powered by onboard electrical systems. While these systems improved upon drone-based limitations, they still depended on external energy sources and control mechanisms, increasing complexity and potential failure points.\n\nTo address these issues, NASA researchers developed a number of kite-based systems in the Aeropod family of kite-based sensing technologies configured to capture atmospheric data efficiently. Over time, various technologies have evolved within the Aeropod family to meet emerging needs, offering expanded capabilities and greater flexibility for researchers. \n\nThe latest advancement in kite-based atmospheric data collection presents a truly passive system that eliminates the need for electrical power or active controls. By leveraging aerodynamic forces, this technology enables seamless ascent and descent along a kite line, offering an efficient and low-maintenance alternative for atmospheric research.",

The incidence of stall conditions requires an operating margin between the stall point and the point of optimum operating efficiency, and typically, the compressor/propulsor fan operates at a lower efficiency point to increase the stall margin. Stall must be avoided to maintain thrust and in some cases to avoid catastrophic failure. While many researchers have explored stall control in the past, it remains a prevailing issue.

This increases the time needed to perform a scan using bulky and high power-consumption mechanisms in order to provide accurate atmospheric molecular measurements.

Within the receiver, a mixer plays a crucial role by combining the incoming signal with a reference signal from a LO producing an IF signal, which retains the spectral information of the original signal but at a lower, more easily processed frequency. Thus, the mixer enables the receiver to convert high-frequency signals into a more manageable form for detailed analysis.\n\nPlanetary observational spectrometers require a receiver with a wide IF bandwidth and low noise temperature to detect molecular species simultaneously in a desired frequency range. Existing mixers have a limited IF range, which may not be viable for future-state NASA remote-sensing applications. As a result, engineers and researchers at NASA have developed a novel compact mixer, achieving a wide IF bandwidth of approximately 70 GHz, a low noise temperature below 4,000 K, and a conversion loss under 12 dB at 470-600 GHz for space applications and may provide significant advantages to commercially-available spectrometers.",

A TR event can propagate to all the cells in a battery pack, escalating into a fire that can be catastrophic. \n\nUse of CFRP sleeves for Li-ion cells provides multiple advantages over previous containment designs: increased hazard safety, lower mass, reduced cost, lack of conductivity, and manufacture with readily available materials.

Traditional DIC software assumes a solid material substrate, but in interwoven materials the substrate consists of bi-directional patterns. This causes errors in strain data derived when the analysis is performed by DIC software alone.",

      "Researchers at the NASA Johnson Space Center have developed a suite of RFID-based technologies focused on improving communication of an RFID reader with a greater number of RFID tags in open and enclosed areas.  Typically, RFID reader communications with tags are spectrum-regulated to a narrow bandwidth that makes tag localization difficult.  Moreover, RFID communications are complicated by polarization mismatches between the reader and tag antennas.  The Agile RFID Antenna System is able to expand these boundaries by integrating an inexpensive frequency multiplexer to the RFID reader antennas, which permits new methods of localization, allows greater antenna functionality with fewer reader RF ports, and provides improved read accuracy and/or range.   For enclosed areas, such as a large container, the Agile RFID Antenna System can use smaller antennas, consequently reducing the volume required for an RFID system to operate.   A wide range of commercial applications can benefit from this <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span>, including retail inventory management, manufacturing/assembly line tracking, industrial transportation and logistics, sports bio-analysis, and healthcare.",

      "Innovators at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) have developed an earthbound robotic training system called “ARGOS” for short. It can actively simulate an astronaut’s weightlessness in space by using an overhead runway and bridge drive system to partially or fully offload their weight using attached cables, effectively suspending them off the ground. Although the test subject’s torso and legs are offloaded, their arms and any weighty hand tools are not.\n\nEnter “ARC ANGEL”. The Actuated Realtime Control for ARGOS Nega-tion of Gravitational Effects on the Limbs (ARC ANGEL) <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> was developed to offload a space suited test subject’s arms and counteract fatigue realized while performing training activities using ARGOS. Like ARGOS, ARC ANGEL provides offloading via computer-controlled active cable tension. Cables are strung between arm cuffs located just above each elbow, and a motorized reel(s) mounted to the spacesuit’s backpack-like Primary Life Support System (PLSS).\n\nThis active offloading <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> could be used for a number of appli-cations in addition to simulating zero to one G environments. For exam-ple, a patient rehabilitating their shoulder could benefit from movement assistance that offloads arm weight or grasp load, a construction worker carrying a heavy tool could more easily manipulate it, or it could offset equipment weight for military personnel ultimately staving off limb fatigue that would otherwise occur.",

These crystals are prone to fracturing in use due to the heat generated and resulting unsymmetrical properties, such as thermal expansion, of the crystal. Most of the energy pumped into a laser crystal becomes excess heat. The faster and more uniformly this heat is dissipated, the better the laser beam performance and the lower the chance of crystal fracture. NASA’s laser crystal mount has been used in an actual laser transmitter system and has essentially eliminated the risk of thermally-induced damage to the laser crystal. Research indicated that the mount reduced the crystal damage rate from 17 crystals in a single year to no-damaged crystals for 4 years.

For wind tunnel applications, particle image velocimetry is often used to determine the interaction of various models and surfaces with surrounding airflows.  Measurements near the wall are particularly relevant and unfortunately exceptionally challenging due to the large level of background noise arising from reflection of incident light off the surface of the model being studied.  Thus, the ability to seed the airflow with a material that can be used to accurately portray the airflow properties (i.e., minimal particle lag) while enabling near wall measurements with improved signal to noise ratio is of high interest to wind tunnel researchers.",

Traditional sensors, such as metal oxide devices, have been utilized for several decades for detection of combustible and toxic gases. However, they are power hungry, and their use is limited. There is a strong need for development of next-generation chemical sensors with higher sensitivity in the parts per million (ppm) to parts per billion (ppb) level and low power consumption. Sensors based on emerging nanotechnology, such as SWCNTs, promise to provide improved performance. NASA scientists came up with an innovative method for gas detection by coating or doping the SWCNTs with suitable materials.

      "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has developed a new, simplified method for installing valve seats, eliminating the need for a swaged assembly process and the additional hardware and equipment that are typically found in conventional, elastomeric valve seat installations. In addition to weight reduction, the fewer hardware components reduce the number of potential failure modes. This simplified technique saves time and installation costs, and results in comparable leakage <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> by minimizing acute stress in the seal material.  \n\nNASA has used the installation technique on gas-fed, pulsed, electric thrusters for propellants, which requires very specific fluid flow operation by quickly opening and closing the valves within short durations of time. The NASA technique is especially advantageous for small instrumentation valves where precise fluid control is essential.",

      "During the Apollo missions, lightly modified off-the-shelf cameras were used by astronauts to take imagery while performing extravehicular activities (EVAs). These cameras were cumbersome to operate in spacesuits that limit body mobility and pressurized gloves that limit finger dexterity and strength, making it difficult to interact with small camera buttons. Additionally, on the lunar surface, several environmental factors pose risks to continued camera operations (e.g., extreme temperatures, intrusive lunar regolith, radiation effects, vacuum conditions, etc.).\n\nTo address these challenges, NASA has developed an adaptive camera assembly designed to enable astronauts dawning spacesuits to easily control all functions of a Nikon Z9 camera. Not only does this NASA invention address human factors considerations (i.e., ease-of-use), but also functions as an environmental <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> system, defending the camera against the effects of extreme environments. NASA’s adaptive camera assembly may provide advantages for terrestrial photography and videography applications involving hazardous environments where thick gloves and other thermal protective equipment are required (e.g., industrial foundries, Arctic/Antarctic research, welding, etc.). Additionally, the camera assembly may enable individuals with disabilities or health conditions that limit hand control to participate in photography.",

Traditionally, this task is accomplished through the use of a Mach Zehnder Modulator (MZM), a primarily analog component. In order to generate a high-fidelity optical signal, the input electrical signal must be of equally high fidelity, which is a difficult task due to the competing requirements of the digital components and the analog modulator. The digital components required to generate the waveform contain non-idealities which degrade the extinction ratio (ER) of the optical signal. The Cascaded Offset Optical Modulator corrects these non-idealities in the electro-optic subsystem during modulation by relieving the SDR of the extreme fidelity requirements imposed by the optical modulator.

However, in order to be used in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectral range between 90 – 130 nm, an optical thin film overcoat is needed to protect the Al and prevent the formation of an Al2O3 layer, which occurs upon exposure to oxygen. Lithium fluoride (LiF) has been a long-standing solution for this purpose, particularly for wavelengths below 120 nm. LiF coatings are opaque between 90 – 102 nm and even generate residual absorption above 102 nm, limiting reflectance at these short wavelengths. LiF coatings also suffer from hygroscopic degradation, leading to a reduction in reflectivity over time when exposed to humid environments.\n\nTo address these challenges, innovators at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have developed an advanced method to produce Al mirrors protected with a LiF overcoat using a novel room-temperature reactive Physical Vapor Deposition (rPVD) process. This method introduces a fluorine-containing xenon di-fluoride (XeF2) gas treatment that enhances the durability and stability of the LiF coating while achieving record-high reflectivity levels in the FUV spectrum.",

This NASA innovation is an Al mirror passivation process that produces a thin AlF3 overcoat layer, preventing further oxidation. The resultant AlF3 overcoat layer offers enhanced reflectivity at shorter (FUV) wavelengths compared to MgF2 and is more environmentally stable relative to LiF.

      "Current microfabrication methods are well established for processing of Si-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and only get more complex with each iteration. This is especially true with 3D transistors that require very selective placement and selective removal of materials required to reach a working product.\n\nHowever, with NASA's newly developed masking and deposition processes, photoresists, UV exposures and selective etching can be eliminated, with metal removal reduced to only planarization. This revised process reduces the total <span class=\"highlight\">material</span> and time requirements drastically when compared to current standards.\n\nThese advancements offer the benefits of increasing total possible throughput while simultaneously reducing manufacturing cost per unit.",
