The goal of STRS is to support waveform application portability, upgradability, and reduce the cost and risk of using Software Defined Radios for NASA. ComplianceTool.sh is a Bourne shell script that tests an STRS application for the appropriate method signatures. The output is a web page containing the results.  ComplianceToolOE.sh is a Bourne shell script that tests the STRS infrastructure for the required named constants, typedefs, and structs. The output is a web page containing the results. The command and compliance application, WFCCN, is ported, compiled, and linked with an STRS infrastructure to verify static compliance such that all required STRS infrastructure-provided methods are implemented as well as the named constants, typedefs, and structs. WFCCN may also be executed for dynamic compliance testing. The tools are described in \"STRS Compliance Testing\", NASA/TM 2011-217266.",

The software package can simulate two-dimensional, axisymmetric, or three-dimensional problems on structured multi-block meshes or unstructured meshes. It also allows one to invoke a parabolic (i.e. space-marching) treatment for any subset of a problem that can accommodate this solution strategy. VULCAN-CFD provides a significant level of geometric flexibility for structured grid simulations by allowing for arbitrary face-to-face C(0) continuous and non-C(0) continuous block interface connectivities. The unstructured grid paradigm allows for mixed element unstructured meshes that contain any combination of tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramid, and hexahedral cell elements. The VULCAN-CFD solver is also fully parallelized using MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries in a data-parallel fashion.",

Furthermore, these Wikimojis: Wiki + Emoji (configuration and management icons of standard business operations -> Emoji portion plus the automatic communications, configuration, management tracking  blog/link type entries for any Microsoft .Net API based interactions or links to other Wikimojis -> Wiki portion) allow for efficient tracking, from informal to formal configuration management levels, of key organizational and management activities in regards to business operations and integration of systems of systems (including IIoT and IoT).  Wikimojis can be grouped into channels that have a common association points or topics.  Lastly Wikimojis can be set to autonomously conduct data mining/information crawling on targeted information systems (the Internet, corporate clouds, organizational e-mail systems, etc.) searching for related events, discussions, and/or data points, making links as appropriate and become a living data entity reaching its full potential as an Internet of Management Thing.

OpenMDAO provides the core software infrastructure to integrate multidisciplinary variable fidelity tools and enable design, analysis, and optimization of complex systems.  Currently, OpenMDAO functionalities include component linking, data passing, driver interface, and lazy evaluation.  This initial basic capability of the framework is sufficient for users to run and optimize their analysis after they integrate their specific component codes.  As OpenMDAO evolves, the following capabilities will be included in the framework:  interprocess communications, error handling, user interfaces, geometry application program interfaces (APIs), plug-in interfaces, utilities to wrap tools, versioning, and parallel processing support.

This paper defines the PeTaL concept and workflow. Biomimicry, biophysics, biomimetics, bionics and numerous other terms refer to the use of biology and biological principles to inform practices in other disciplines. For the most part, the domain of inquiry in these fields have been confined to extant biological models with the proponents of biomimicry often citing the evolutionary success of extant organisms relative to extinct ones. The primary objective of this paper is to expand the domain of inquiry for human processes that seek to model those that are, were or could be found in nature with examples that relate to the field of <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> and to spur development of tools that can work together to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in problem solving. Specifically specialized fields such as paleomimesis, anthropomimesis and physioteleology are proposed in conjunction with artificial evolution. Blockchain technology may be vital in allowing open source design tools such as PeTaL to democratize design and yet protect intellectual property. The overarching philosophy outlined here can be thought of as physiomimetics, a holistic and systematic way of learning from natural history. The backbone of PeTaL integrates an unstructured database with an ontological model consisting of function, morphology, environment, state of matter and ecosystem. Tools include text classification, thesaurus, data visualization, and analysis. Applications of PeTaL include guiding human space exploration, understanding human and geological history, and discovering new or extinct life.",

      "PSYCO: Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (PSYCO), is a software environment that generates precise Java component interfaces in an automated fashion. These interfaces are state machines that describe legal sequences of method invocations of a component. Guards on method parameters are included in the automata transitions in order to capture more precisely the interface behavior of the component. The novelty of PSYCO is that it is the first software environment to combine symbolic approaches with automata learning. In particular, it uses a technique named concolic execution to compute guards and active automata learning to compute legal sequences of invocations. Concolic execution is a static analysis that executes a program concretely, while computing symbolic constraints and using them to automatically trigger different program behaviors in order to exhaustively explore the input space of a component. Existing concolic test case generation tools handle only very few data types (especially no float types) and no native calls (e.g., native implementation of trigonometric functions) and thus do not scale to industrial (and in particular <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span>) applications. The concolic execution engine in PSYCO (named JDART) overcomes many of these shortcomings. Active automata learning has been used as a dynamic analysis for generating control models of software components. A learning algorithm triggers a variety of executions on a target system, and based on the outcomes, produces models of the component. These models are automatically refined based on counterexamples that demonstrate imprecisions of each proposed model. Concolic execution and active automata learning target two different types of component invariants: data invariants and control invariants. The combination of both allows the formulation of precise interfaces, integrating control and data aspects of components. Existing interface generation tools usually focus on one of these two aspects and do not combine constraints on inputs and outputs with control models. ",

      "Detect and Avoid Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems (DAIDALUS)",
      "DAIDALUS (Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems) is a software library that implements a detect-and-avoid concept for unmanned <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> systems. At the core of the concept, there is a mathematical definition of the well-clear concept. Two <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> are considered to be well clear of each other if appropriate distance and time variables determined by the relative <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> states remain outside a set of predefined threshold values. These distance and time variables are closely related to variables used in the Resolution Advisory (RA) logic of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System Version II (TCAS II).DAIDALUS includes algorithms for determining the current well-clear status between two <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> and for predicting a well-clear violation within a lookahead time, assuming non-maneuvering trajectories. DAIDALUS implements algorithms for computing maneuver guidance, assuming a simple kinematic trajectory model for the ownship. Maneuver guidance is computed in the form of range of track, ground speed, vertical speed, and altitude values called bands. These bands represent areas in the airspace the ownship has to avoid in order to maintain well-clear with respect to traffic <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span>. In the case of a loss of well-clear, or when a well-clear violation is unavoidable, the maneuver guidance algorithms provide well-clear recovery bands. Recovery bands represents areas in the airspace that allow the ownship to regain well-clear status in a timely manner according to its performance limits. Recovery bands are designed so that they also protect against a user-specified minimum horizontal and vertical separation. DAIDALUS also implements a pair-wise alerting logic that is based on a list of increasingly conservative alert levels.DAIDALUS is implemented in C++ and Java. The definition of a family of well-clear volumes is also available in Matlab. The software library is modular and highly configurable.  The functional requirements of DAIDALUS algorithms have been formally specified in the Prototype Verification System (PVS). The correctness of these algorithms with respect to their functional requirements has been formally verified in PVS.  Furthermore, the software implementations have been validated against the formal models using stressing test cases.",

      "MVL-15 is a Modified Vortex-Lattice (MVL) aerodynamics analysis code. The term modified refers to the primary modification of the core vortex-lattice methodology: the incorporation and assignment of viscous aerodynamics data associated with the wing section geometry to the inviscid vortex-lattice solution via iterative computational procedures. The strategy essentially converts an inviscid and purely analytic linearized method to a semi-empirical blend which retains the rapid execution speed of the linearized method while empirically characterizing the viscous aerodynamics at all spanwise lattice points. For the analysis of airplane configurations consisting of more than one wing, the resulting spanwise section aerodynamics can be integrated to determine the aerodynamics of each wing, both separately and combined. As implemented, the methodology inherently provides the capability to determine the non-linear viscous effects on lift and drag at relatively high angles of attack, to identify the maximum lift coefficient, and to characterize the onset of stall. Furthermore, the methodology provides the capability to determine the lift and drag associated with the application of <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> design strategies for lift augmentation such as the use of flaps or blowing. The MVL-15 code is applicable to the analysis of <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> in cruise configurations; however, it is most advantageously applied to the analysis of <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> in various high-lift configurations.",

The software utilizes input information of the airflow surrounding the body of interest and then calculates trajectories of approaching water droplets, the mass and energy transfer processes at the surface of the body, and the resulting ice mass and the shape it will take on the body. This version of the software includes coverage of the full range of icing conditions from the standard envelope encompassed by FAA CFR 14, Part 25, Appendix C, up through super-cooled large droplet (SLD) icing conditions. The computational results have been compared to an extensive database of ice shape profiles obtained from experimental measurements and the software has shown a very good ability to reproduce such profiles under most conditions of interest to the aviation community. This validation effort has made the LEWICE3D software one of the most extensively tested ice accretion prediction tools available.The LEWICE3D software is made up of several modules or processes.

The mass flux information is used for subsequent ice growth calculations and is also useful for ice protection system design.  The final module or process predicts the ice shape by modeling the freezing process in small finite control volumes.

The modeling and simulation architecture comprises aerodynamic and propulsion models that are valid for all-attitude flight conditions such as extreme relative wind angles (e.g. high angle of attack and sideslip angles), very high vehicle angular rates typical of loss-of-control events, vortex ring state conditions, and onboard system or component failures. The aerodynamic and propulsion models are derived using specialized wind tunnel test methods that replicate extreme off-nominal flight conditions.",

      "<p>This software program offers a reliable method for calculating theoretical fatigue crack growths that could lead to catastrophic structural component failures. The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. This innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.</p><p>Developed to calculate the number of operational life flights for B-52B pylon hooks, the program and underlying theories can be applied to estimate the service life of any critical structural component. </p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Reliable: Predicts operational flight life of critical aerostructural components</p><p> * Accurate: Considers a comprehensive suite of test data by counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, including secondary mini-amplitude half-cycles that do not cross mean stress lines</p><p> * Customized: Identifies potential structural problem areas and calculates the number of safe flights an aerostructure can make based on its particular duty cycle</p><p> * Economical: Saves monetary costs associated with loss of expensive equipment due to component failures</p><p> * Adaptable: Offers applicability to other industries, with modifications to the input model</p><p>POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</p><p> * Spacecraft</p><p> * <span class=\"highlight\">Aircraft</span></p><p> * Ships</p><p> * Oil rigs</p><p> * Windmills </p><p> * Bridges</p><p> * Oscillating industrial equipment used in mines and quarries</p><p>HOW IT WORKS</p><p>The Half-Cycle Crack Growth Computer Program is a powerful and practical tool for visualizing crack growth curves associated with critical stress points. It was designed to determine the number of safe operational flights an <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> can make without structural component failures due to fatigue crack growth. The computer program was developed after two rear B-52B pylon hooks failed simultaneously during an Armstrong test operation. Subsequent examinations revealed that hook failure was caused by rapid crack propagation from existing micro cracks that had been masked by chrome-plated surfaces and thus were undetected during visual inspections.</p><p>To obtain baseline data for use in the program, the critical structural components must be proof-load tested to determine the initial theoretical crack size based on fracture mechanics. Next, strain gauges are installed in the vicinity of stress concentration points and are calibrated to record the applied loads. After the failure-critical components are identified, stress analysis is performed for each component to establish the functional relationship between the applied load and the induced tangential stress at the critical stress point. The program reads the data and selects the maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of the random flight loading spectra. Program outputs are used to generate and display crack growth curves, providing a visual warning for preventing catastrophic structural failures.</p><p>For the B-52B pylon hooks discussed above, crack growth curves were produced for each hook, allowing visual observation of the crack growth behavior during the entire air-launching or captive flight. The crack growth curves provided the visual knowledge that taxiing, takeoff, drop/landing, and sometimes gusts induced a major portion of the total crack growth per operation.</p><p>Written in the C programming language, the program can be adapted for use in other industries by modifying the input model (i.e., data format load spectrum files) for the most expensive and mission critical components.</p><p>WHY IT IS BETTER</p><p>The program examines test data in a much more detailed fashion than other fatigue crack growth modeling software, counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, so it is able to make better predictions about component life. By improving fatigue and failure predictions, the software provides safer flights and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, these predictions allow engineers to determine the critical points during operation that the majority of stress is placed on a particular component, which could allow for better component design that takes those specific forces into account.</p>",

      "<p>Developers at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center have developed a software toolkit--dubbed Chapter 10 Tools--that is capable of reading data files originating from various onboard digital recorders that follow the Range Commanders Council Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106 Chapter 10 Digital Recording Standard but use differing interpretations of that standard.</p><p>The toolkit reads data files regardless of the vendor implementation of the source recorder, displays the data, and even identifies and corrects errors. Ultimately, it produces a data file that can be successfully processed post-flight.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools was developed in response to ongoing challenges researchers at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range faced when attempting to process data files originating from various vendors' digital recorders. As Chapter 10 experienced rapid growth as a technology standard for data recording, many digital recorder vendors began interpreting the standard differently--resulting in errors and variations (sometimes even between one vendor's different firmware versions of the same recorder). While some errors could be identified with Chapter 10 validation software, the type of error was not always apparent, making fixes problematic. These errors and variations can prevent software from reading and processing the data file, thereby effectively making the data unavailable.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools eliminates these challenges with a flexible software toolkit that gives users visibility into the data file's individual data packets, allowing for both manual and automatic correction of errors. An additional Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard (TMATS) editor offers the ability to modify and add details to the TMATS file. Because <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> personnel typically only include enough information in the TMATS portion of the Chapter 10 data file to allow for data recording, this leaves a gap in ground personnel's ability to process that data. So, the TMATS editor enables error correction and provides the ability to add the additional information needed to process the data.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is now in widespread use at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.</p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Diagnostic: Accurately identifies errors and variations in various Chapter 10 data files, as well as the error type</p><p> * Flexible: Offers a flexible architecture enabling visibility into individual data packets</p><p> * Easy to use: Autocorrects most errors, and makes manual error identification and correction simple and streamlined</p><p>APPLICATIONS</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is ideal for:</p><p> * NASA flight data processors needing to reconcile data between varying flight data recorders</p><p> * Software developers looking to integrate error identification and correction capabilities into their Chapter 10 toolkits</p>",

The essential characteristic of a \"rarefied\" flow is that the molecular mean free path is not negligible.The software has been designed to be as automated as possible to achieve a quality solution with minimal user input and control by performing dynamic adaptations of the grid, local time step, and surface temperature.  The gas model includes internal degrees of freedom (rotational, vibrational, and electronic), gas phase chemical reactions, and surface reactions.

      "Methodology and software were implemented to automatically detect Sargassum spp., a floating aquatic seaweed, in 30-meter LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. This Sargassum spp. detection is an extended form of Hus approach to derive a floating algae index (FAI), which is defined as the difference between the reflectance at the near infrared band (NIR, 859 nm) (vegetation red edge) and the linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (SWIR, 1240 or 1640 nm). The Hus <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, but we extended it for use with the OLI bands (655, 865, and 1609 nm), which are comparable to MODIS bands (645, 859, and 1640 nm). We also developed a high resolution true color product to mask cloud pixels in the OLI scene by applying a threshold to top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances in the red (655 nm), green (561 nm), and blue (443 nm) wavelengths, and software to remove false positive identifications of Sargassum spp in the imagery. Hus <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> derives a FAI for each Sargassum spp identified pixel. Our <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> only flags the presence of Sargassum spp in an OLI pixel by indicating that any pixel with a FAI > 0.0 is a Sargassum spp pixel. Additionally, our software geo-locates the flagged Sargassum spp pixels identified in the OLI imagery into the U.S. Navy Global HYCOM model grid.  One element of the model grid used, covers an area 0.125degree of latitude by 0.125 degree of longitude. An OLI pixel is only 30m by 30 m.   To resolve the differences in spatial coverage, a scheme was developed in which the total  number of Landsat OLI pixels within a grid element of the model are counted, and if more than 1% of those pixels are pixels flagged as containing Sargassum spp, then the geographical location within the model is annotated. The end product is an ASCII file that contains latitude, longitude pairs that are used as input for the next stage in the processing stream, which is a clustering <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> or a model initialization parameter. The numerical model grid must be in p lace before the geolocation takes place.The  focus of this application is the automatic identification of Sargassum spp. in visible data of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board LANDSAT-8 in the Gulf of Mexico.  The identification is followed up by a routine to map their location inside the Hybrid  Coordinate Ocean Model MODEL (HYCOM) surface grid.  This methodology, developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the NASA/Applied Science and Technology Project (ASTPO), is applicable worldwide requiring only minor  changes  in the geolocation of the area of interest.",

      "ADOPT (abbr. Automatic Discovery Of Precursors in Time series) is a data mining/ machine learning <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> that processes large volumes of time series data and identifies precursors to adverse events. An adverse event may refer to any unsafe event ranging from a negligible safety hazard to a catastrophic accident, depending on the scope of the analysis. A precursor is an early indicator of an increasing likelihood of the adverse event. Identifying precursors is important in the context of a proactive safety management because precursors detect the increasing severity of the underlying hazard much earlier, giving sufficient time to identify, analyze and implement corrective actions. ADOPT analyzes large volumes of historical data to find complex trends among several sensory variables simultaneously to find precursors. ADOPT's data mining approach captures real-world effects such as human factors, weather, geographic constraints, operating procedures, airline strategies etc. that are difficult to capture using first-principle models. The following are ADOPT's capabilities - new functionality to discover precursors to events of interest by mining time series data, reduces the time required by subject matter experts to discover and analyze precursors from large volumes of data, detects the likelihood of the adverse event earlier to alert the operator on an impending failure, assists in explaining the event of interest with identified precursors.The ADOPT <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> is a general methodology that does not make any special assumptions about the system and does not need specialized knowledge on the system states enabling it to operate directly on the observed time series data. Further, it can scale well to multivariate time series and can analyze large number of  flights, which may enable a faster turnaround time for subsequent tasks such as hazard identification and safety risk analysis. A subject matter expert may require a few hours to analyze a flight for precursors which is not scalable considering the thousands of  flights operated on a daily basis. Also, human experts may not be able to visualize hundreds of time series variables to notice complex variations and trends in the data. ADOPT may be used to speed this process by analyzing the thousands of  flights that operate every day to short-list only the significant precursors which may then be analyzed by a subject matter expert, reducing the turnaround time for safety analysis.While the motivation to find precursors came from analyzing safety (negative events), the method is general to be applied to performance issues as well as to understand positive events such as finding precursors to a high throughput operation at an airport.",

      "NASATrussOpt: Software for truss structure optimization considering member and joint strength, buckling, and nested truss configurations",
      "TrussOpt23 is a research code that is used to develop and test augmentations to existing 2D truss structure optimization algorithms to add consideration for stability, joint strength, and dynamic load cases. The end goal are manufacturable truss designs relevant to spacecraft and lunar infrastructure applications. The following paragraphs describe some more about the technical approach. The code was developed primarily by Matthew Yates during his Fall 2023 NIFS internship and is being released to enable continued collaboration with Matthew and his research group at Georgia Tech leading to research publications demonstrating the approach weve developed. We do not anticipate any other external users or engineering applications.In general the approach is an iterative solution to the convex truss optimization problem defined in [1]. The iterations are used to address nonconvex problem aspects. The approach is mostly a unique combination of previously published approaches. The member-adding <span class=\"highlight\">algorithm</span> described in [2] is used, since it significantly reduces computational expense. Stability is addressed following Tyas [3] and Poulsen [4], where nominal lateral forces and linearized Euler buckling are included.Joint sizing is usually not addressed in truss layout and sizing routines. A uniform arbitrary joint penalty has been introduced to penalize short members, which has the effect of reducing the number of members in the final design, enhancing manufacturability. We adopt a variable joint penalty, based on the loads at the joint. We assume a lap joint configuration and evaluate the length of the overlap using a closed-form solution based on fracture mechanics analysis from Papini [5]. An additional input is added: the fracture toughness of the joint. The fracture mechanics solution leads to an overlap length, which in turns leads to a volume (mass) penalty. The joint volume penalty has a similar influence as previous implementations of joint costs: it tends to rationalize the truss design. In cases where the joint load exceeds the joint capacity for long overlaps, a penalty function is used to prevent infeasible designs. The joint overlaps are updated iteratively until converged.For applications where dynamic loads are important, the mass characteristics of the structure influence the loads. As a result, as the design is updated while searching for a solution, the loads are also changing. We address this scenario for the particular case of a cantilever beam type structure with an end mass subject to base excitation. A lumped mass idealization is used wherein the beam (truss) mass is considered at the tip but with a scaling factor representative of the distribution of mass along the length of the structure. For a uniform cross section, the scaling factor is 0.23. We calculate this factor from the truss layout and sizing using the derivation originally developed by Timoshenko [6]. The scaling factor is updated iteratively until the solution converges.1. M. Gilbert and A.

Fits for 1,068 common elemental and molecular species are contained within the database. The fitting coefficients provide predictive values covering a wide range of temperatures (in many cases for gas state species from 298.15 to 6,000 K). A total of 1,760 fits are included covering gas, solid, and liquid phases. Thermochemical properties that can conveniently be computed from the data fits include specific heat, entropy, enthalpy, free energy, and reduced free energy. The software is a Microsoft Excel-based application and allows extracted data to be used as inputs to other thermochemistry codes or used to compute thermochemical properties within Excel using supplied macros. Data fits can be extracted based on elemental composition or the fits for specific chemical species can be selected. Additionally, the program allows the user to plot both the original JANAF data and the associated fits of the thermochemical properties versus temperature. This can be helpful in visualizing the behavior of the thermodynamic properties.",

As various technologies have advanced, however, both the rate and efficiency with which data can be effectively transferred have grown incredibly quickly.  This has left existing craft unable to utilize more than a small fraction of available capacity.  Further, to date, most known implementations of DTN have been designed to operate on the spacecraft themselves.The innovation, in this case, is a software prototype called High-speed DTN (or HDTN).  HDTN takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to offer substantial improvement on latency and throughput with respect to DTN implementations that exist today.  Specifically, our implementation maintains compatibility with existing implementations of DTN that conform to IETF RFC 5050, while simultaneously defining a new data format that is better suited to higher-rate operation in many cases.  It defines and adopts a massively parallel, pipelined, and message-oriented architecture, which allows the system to scale gracefully as the resources available to the system increase.

      "While methane observing systems are proliferating there remain serious gaps in terms of data systems and analytic frameworks that can fully exploit them. Through our collective exposure to remote-sensing based methane research and applied science we assess that currently there is no information system <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> that can address the improvements in data analysis latency, discoverability, data fusion and on-demand analytics required by the research community and public and private sector decision makers. We propose to develop a Multi-scale Methane Analytic Framework (M2AF) that can help address one of the more persistent challenges in Earth System Science: understanding the causes for the changing atmospheric growth rate of methane. M2AF will lay the foundation for extending existing methane analysis systems beyond their current experimental states, reduce latency and cost of methane data analysis and improve accessibility by researchers and decision makers. To meet these needs M2AF will advance and uniquely bring together multiple observational data sets, models and analysis methods to estimate methane fluxes across three key, overlapping spatial scales in order to disentangle confounding processes: 1) global to regional scale, 2) regional to local scale, and 3) facility (point source scale). M2AF will offer workflow optimization and management tools to improve automation, data search and discovery tools for improved access to intermediate and final products, as well as on-demand analytics and web- based tools for interacting with diverse data sets. MRSDS is the output of the M2AF project.",

      "OnSight allow scientists and engineers to immerse themselves within a reconstruction of the terrain around the Curiosity rover. Prior to OnSight, scientists worked primarily by viewing 2D images or panoramas sent back by the Curiosity rover. However, it is extremely difficult to get a sense of three dimensional relationships by viewing 2D images. Three-dimensional visualization on traditional computer screens has been available to a subset of Mars mission operations teams since the late 1990s. However, these interfaces have not been available to the full mission science team and do not offer the intuitive understanding that is gained when one explores the environment in the same ways that they explore an environment on Earth.Using an immersive display, OnSight can render a reconstruction of Mars at full scale, and allow users to navigate the model by simply walking and looking around. This interaction model requires little to no training, because it takes advantage of motor skills and spatial reasoning abilities that humans develop instinctively. It also enables field scientists to access the skills and intuition that they have developed while exploring environments on Earth. OnSight provides the closest experience to working on Mars without physically being there. By enabling users to utilize all their spatial reasoning ability, users gain improved spatial comprehension of the environment, which enables them to efficiently plan safe rover operations and make new scientific discoveries.OnSight was developed for the context of Mars exploration, but the system provides general capability for visualization and virtual presence in a remote environment. There are many potential applications of <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span>, including Earth based terrain visualization (e.g. caves, lava fields, remote field sites), as well as other planetary and asteroid surfaces.",

      "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited.magnetic bearings are an enabling <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> for rotating devices with extremely high rotational speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International Space Station.  In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance.",

      "DTN Marshall Enterprise is a fully compliant CCSDS Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) router that has been used to conduct International Space Station (ISS) payload operations for many years. Communications in space are characterized by their disrupted, wireless nature. Whether due to occultation, scheduling, cost or solar flares, spacecraft must handle interruptions in connectivity and data losses. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) using the bundle protocol (BP) can maximize the efficient use of links to and among spacecraft. As part of NASAs efforts to deploy DTN in space, the HOSC developed a general purpose DTN router based on the SourceForge DTN2 version 6 reference code and reinvented a previously develop capability called the External Router. This allows non-network cognizant operators to manage the ground gateway as though it were another piece of the ground system without perturbing its actual specifications. The HOSC has deployed their implementation of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) to payloads on the International Space Station (ISS).The current request is to export and make available for <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> transfer the current DTNME implementation. It is also desirable for it to reside on github.com/NASA/DTNME. DTNME implemented DTN protocols as primarily defined by RFC 5050 and several other RFCs. This was also used by the HOSC to verify a new CCSDS standard (Bundle Protocol Specification CCSDS 734.2-B-1) that is used in various programs.  The standard or the next generation is now being targeted for Gateway. After successfully using it operationally, we have accumulated a new patch set. The combined implementation is what we would like to release as DTNME v0.1. DTN2 software updates were originally released to SourceForge.net under NTR# 1428003694. This was a patch update that incorporated functionality of the CCSDS standard and pre-operational generic features used on the ISS.",

      "The engine icing risk prediction code, COMDES-MELT, is a mean-line compressor analysis code coupled with an ice crystal thermodynamic state code.  The COMDES-MELT code computes the velocity, pressure, temperature, and flow angles at the leading edge and trailing edge of each blade row, at the hub, mean, and tip sections. This compressor code includes the ability to calculate the effects of water vapor on the fluid properties of the air  water vapor mixture based on the mole fraction of air to water vapor. The relative humidity at the engine inlet is specified, and the local specific humidity (mass of water/mass of air) is computed through each component of the inlet-fan-LPC, taking the sublimation, melting, and evaporation of an ice particle into consideration, as well as the local air temperature. The resulting effect of the humid air on the performance of the compressor is computed.  Several key parameters have been identified as early indicators of ice accretion: the local wet-bulb temperature, the melt ratio within each blade row, and the ice water flow rate to air flow rate ratio.  The local wet-bulb temperature is calculated at each blade row. The geometry section of the code is defined by simple circular <span class=\"highlight\">arc</span> rotors and stators including stage axial gaps. As the ice particles passes though the compression rotors, stators, and gaps the ice particle melting and evaporation model computes the local melt ratio, change in enthalpy, and particle temperature and diameter through each compressor component.  The ratio of ice water flow rate to the air flow rate is computed at the inlet based on the ice water content in the atmosphere and the mass flow rate of air entering the engine.  If the limiting values of these key parameters are met, there is a risk that ice will accrete on the surfaces of the compressor. With these parameters as the precursors to ice accretion, the blade row within the compression system can be identified that is likely to experience ice buildup at a particular engine operating condition in the vehicle flight trajectory.",

Given a specific modeling paradigm that can be learned using appropriate data-driven or machine learning techniques, an optimal alarm system can be designed to elicit the fewest false alarms for a fixed detection probability. When the modeling paradigm is a simple stationary linear dynamic system driven by white Gaussian noise, it is easy to use the well-known Kalman filter to enable value prediction of future process values. During implementation, these value predictions can subsequently be used to enable the prediction of associated level-crossing events that may occur in the future, using a parameter that was selected to achieve robustly optimal performance during the alarm system design stage.",

      "The Random Variable Library is a C++ software library that provides a framework for uncertainty representation using probability distributions. The presence of uncertainty poses significant challenges for calculating predictions and decision-making, particularly in the context of operation of engineering systems. Many existing tools for prediction do not include the impact of uncertainty or make assumptions regarding the different sources of uncertainty. The Random Variable Library presents a solution to overcome these challenges and represent various forms of uncertainty. In particular, standard parametric distributions such Gaussian, Lognormal, etc. are supported, in addition to non-parametric representations such as unweighted/weighted samples, percentiles, etc. It is extendable, allowing for the addition of additional distributions. Beyond representation, the library includes basic capabilities for multivariate sampling and fitting using several methods. This can be used to facilitate certain uncertainty management activities such as uncertainty propagation and likelihood calculations.",

Automation support is supplied by the APRES Service, which includes components that provide the following capabilities:(1) plan simulation, which determines the state and numeric chronicles (values of the model variables over time) and determines when \"processes\" are triggered and terminated based on world states in the execution trace, (2) violation detection of constraints and flight rules encoded in the domain model, as well as of user-created temporal constraints, (3) violation resolution suggestions as to how to fix the plan's violations. The user controls when and how to utilize the automation support.The APRES Service components are based on the Action Notation Modeling Language (ANML) which is a highly expressive, powerful language for specification of domain models. ANML enables the specification of an extensive variety of flight rules and resource usage (e.g., one can represent continuous effects).  In addition to action definitions, ANML models can include definitions of \"processes\", which are not under the control of the agent or human planner, e.g., the operation of a survival heater that is powered on and off based on the current temperature. Integrated with the APRES system is a web-based ANML Editor for creating, editing, and debugging domain models.

      "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited",

The wave equation is derived by manipulating the Navier-Stokes equation into a \"propagation\" left-hand side and a \"source\" right-hand side. The wave equation is solved using the free-space Green's function, giving an expression with two surface integrals and one volume integral (typically ignored). The integrands of these integrals represent the acoustic sources in the flow, and computing them requires knowledge of the motion of and forces acting on the integration surfaces.

      "Thermal engineers often create custom heat maps to analyze their thermal models. However, generating a heat map is difficult because thermal simulations only readily provide certain attributes of simulated nodes, such as temperature, capacitance, and heat generation, along with a network of conductances. Heat flow values are quantities derived from these nodal attributes, and the difficulty in data processing and management of heat flow between nodes quickly grows as node count increases for large models. Deriving a network of heat flow values requires a vast amount of calculations and data handling, and the heat map generation process generally suffers from processing speed, loss of accuracy, and/or presentation of data in a clear and concise format. Heat Analysis Manager (HAM) is a Thermal Desktop (TD) based free multi-purpose tool developed to aid thermal engineers in analyzing thermal models which includes a heat map generation utility. HAMs heat map generator retains accuracy and fast processing speed by utilizing TDs application programming interface (API) and TDs built-in post-processor routine Qflow from Results. Furthermore, HAMs heat map output is presented in an easily customizable format in Excel, allowing users to create various custom visual heat maps. A full description of how HAM utilizes TDs API to create a customizable heat map is provided. A simple model demonstration is included along with step-by-step procedures for creating custom heat maps. HAMs heat map output has been verified against TD and other heat map generation software, and the verification methods used are shown.",

From this table, the software automatically generates a standard programmatic view called a 'sand chart.One anticipated use of the PCT, then, is to filter out those architectures in an analysis of alternatives (AoA) that clearly do not meet the affordability test. Another is to show the comparative programmatic costs over time for multiple specific architectures. These kinds of analyses are especially helpful when applied early in the architecture definition process.

      "The code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks) has been developed over the last years at the NASA Johnson Space Center to simulate the effects of ionizing radiations at the microscopic scale and to understand the effects of space radiation at the biological level. The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a step-by-step diffusion-reaction program based on the Greens functions of the diffusion equation. This approach is also used to simulate the indirect effect of ionizing radiation on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user. It includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and a 3D OpenGL visualization interface. The calculations are executed simultaneously (in parallel) on multiple CPUs. ",

      "Conventional Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction evolved from multi-band approaches and generally does not exploit the full spectral measurement. We hypothesize that a pure spectroscopic approach can improve atmospheric inversion accuracy to minimize regional biases in global-scale investigations. Such techniques are pervasive in atmospheric remote sounding disciplines, where Optimal Estimation (OE) retrieval theory (Rodgers et al., 2000) inverts a radiance spectrum to recover a consistent physical model incorporating, for example, aerosol and H2O, the interactions between scattering, absorption, and the coupling between surface reflectance and atmosphere. This enables a statistically rigorous treatment of uncertainty with the potential to recover information on spectrally-broad signals. Our software demonstrates a proof of concept that overcomes the primary computational roadblock of these methods: fast execution of line-by-line Radiative Transfer (RT) models. Neural <span class=\"highlight\">Network</span> (NN) emulation can replicate the results of the MODTRAN 6.0 line-by-line A-band model to high accuracy and a five order of magnitude improvement in execution time.

An input for the ANN is a set of structure coefficients, characterizing the local atomic environment of each atom, for which the atomic energy is obtained in the ANN inference process. The ANN gives optimized parameters for a predefined empirical function, known as bond-order-potential (BOP). Thus parameterized BOP function is then used to calculate the energy of an atom.

For DS pixels, FRInGE uses all possible interferometric pairs. Starting from a coregistered stack of SAR images, FRInGE evaluates the temporal distribution of the backscatter of SAR images at each pixel to identify statistically self-similar neighbors in a pre-defined window. The neighborhood map also helps to identify PS pixels. FRInGE forms a full covariance matrix of interferometric pairs for each DS pixel over its neighborhood. The wrapped phase time-series of the DS pixels is estimated as the phase of the generalized eigen vector corresponding to the largest eigen values of the covariance matrix. The phase series of the PS pixels are also extracted and together with the estimated phase series of DS pixels can be unwrapped through a minimum span tree <span class=\"highlight\">network</span> using two-dimensional available unwrappers. The estimated unwrapped phase time-series of DS and PS pixels inclusive of all components (e.g., ground displacement, geometrical residuals, propagation delay) can be post-processed through already available tools to estimate displacement time-series.

      "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential to provide meaningful and reliable predictions of real-world system performance. One major obstacle for the implementation of statistical methods for UQ is the use of expensive computational models. Classical UQ methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generally require thousands to millions of model evaluations, and, when coupled with an expensive model, result in excessive solve times that can render the analysis intractable. These methods are also inherently serial, which prohibits speedup by high performance <span class=\"highlight\">computing</span>. Recently, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has emerged as a powerful alternative to MCMC. In contrast, this method allows for parallel model evaluations, realizing significant speedup. This software is an implementation of SMC that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to provide users general access to parallel UQ methods in Python 2.7.To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python 2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be estimated, and provides data to be used for calibration. SMC sampling can then be conducted with ease through instantiation of the SMC class and a call to the sample() method. The output of this process is an approximation of the parameter posterior probability distribution conditioned on the data provided.",

      "Several software algorithms are implemented as Matlab code to compute the loudness level of an array of sonic boom waveforms that are input to the code (named Narrow-band Octave-band Metrics, or NOM for short).  The following quantities are computed and returned by this software for each of the input waveforms: loudness level metrics PL, PNL, ASEL, BSEL, CSEL, DSEL, ESEL, GSEL, ZSEL, ISBAP; the weighted sound pressure levels LAF_max, LBF_max, LCF_max, LDF_max, LEF_max, LGF_max, LAS_max, LBS_max, LCS_max, LDS_max, LES_max, LGS_max; the weighted sound pressure time histories LAF, LBF, LCF, LDF, LEF, LGF, LAS, LBS, LCS, LDS, LES, LGS; the loudness spectra in units of sone; the fractional-octave band sound pressure level spectra.  An ambient noise correction can be applied using methods outlined in ISO 11204:2010(E) Sections 5.4.2 and 7 using either of the two accuracy grades documented within that standard or also several methods based loosely on that standard but that have been customized for this application - sonic boom signals.

      "Scalable Implementation of Finite Elements by NASA (ScIFEN) is a three-dimensional solid mechanics code that provides a parallel implementation of the finite element method (FEM). Generally speaking, the FEM is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, ScIFEN uses the FEM to solve the PDEs that govern the motion and deformation of solid materials under the action of external loads. Thus, ScIFEN uses input information describing a solid's geometry, material properties, applied forces, etc. to compute and return the resulting mechanical response (e.g. displacements, stresses, etc.). ScIFEN is a parallel code written in C++ and designed to scale to large problems that can be run on supercomputers across many processors. This scalability and efficiency is enabled through the utilization of several open-source high performance <span class=\"highlight\">computing</span> libraries. The most heavily used libraries include: 1) Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) for the parallel solution of linear/non-linear systems of equations, 2) Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) for general parallel input/output, and 3) Mesh Orientated Database (MOAB) for storage and managing finite element mesh data in parallel. ScIFEN includes several standard linear and non-linear material models including linear elastic isotropic, linear hardening plasticity, and crystal plasticity models. It supports various applied loadings including prescribed displacements and forces, surface tractions and pressures, and body forces. ScIFEN supports both implicit time integration (ScIFEi driver) and explicit time integration (ScIFEx driver).",

The package is modular and gives access to all the building blocks required of a liquid or specific types of air cooling systems. These components include heat exchangers, heat sinks, tubes, inlets, nozzles, heat loads, and pumps. It also contains a method of populating flow characteristics and utilizes several methods of characterization including using table, and the open source package CoolProp. Because the module is built within OpenMDAO, design optimization can be utilized to determine the dimensions of heat exchangers, tubing diameters, pump sizes, and <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> architectures.",

The ART is intended to be especially useful for performing design-tradeoff studies and statistical analyses to support the rational development of design requirements for multispectral imaging systems. Among other things, the ART affords a capability to synthesize coarser-spatial-resolution image-data sets from finer-spatial-resolution data sets and multispectral-image-data products from hyperspectral-image-data products. The ART also provides for synthesis of image-degradation effects, including point-spread functions, misregistration of spectral images, and noise. The ART can utilize real or synthetic data sets, along with sensor specifications, to create simulated data sets. In one example of a typical application, simulated data pertaining to an existing multispectral sensor <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> are used to verify the data collected by the <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> in operation. In the case of a proposed sensor <span class=\"highlight\">system</span>, the simulated data can be used to conduct trade studies and statistical analyses to ensure that the sensor <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> will satisfy the requirements of potential scientific, academic, and commercial user communities.

      "NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) provides a full-resolution image archive of over 70 million images and access to services for over 700 NASA Earth science data products covering every part of the world. Most imagery is available within 3-5 hours after satellite overpass and some products span almost 30 years. While the GIBS satellite data remains highly accessible, it remains largely underexploited and analyzed due to its scale. The development of algorithms to ensure the consistency of data is critical for near-real time (NRT) applications. We identify two machine learning tasks: (1) data validation and (2) natural event detection. For data validation we will apply machine learning techniques to validate images for missing data patterns and miscoloration. For natural event detection we illustrate the promise of deep learning to leverage the scale of GIBS imagery to learn state-of-the-art algorithms. Lastly, we implement an operational machine learning <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> to process new images and notify GIBS operators.",

Three additional spheres are located at the midpoint of the three vertical rods. The distance between any set of vertices-spheres defines the characteristic pyramid length.

This NTR focuses on modeling and development of new code infrastructure of steady state flow boiling through the transfer line that connects a propellant tank to an engine or customer receiver tank, which is required to set limits on the allowable heat flux into the line. Using the largest ever collection of available cryogenic heated tube data, universal cryogenic flow boiling correlations were recently developed for various regimes of the boiling curve. However, to model flow boiling in heated tubes, these individual correlations must be patched together to provide a continuous predictive curve of wall superheat as a function of preponderant parameters. This NTR covers the individual flow boiling correlations along with the logic and methodology for patching the correlations together to produce a single continuous boiling curve in a user-defined subroutine. In turn, the subroutine can be called by higher order lumped capacitance codes such as Thermal Desktop.",

Crucial to reconfiguring swarms is the ability to maneuver individual satellites between prespecified start and end positions in a fixed amount of time.However, there is no consensus solution on how to do these single satellite maneuvers fuel-efficiently in the general case. Consider the position of a single satellite in the swarms Local Vertical/Local Horizontal (LVLH) reference frame relative to the swarms reference orbit.  For specific single satellite transition scenarios, such as transferring the satellite between LVLH passive reference orbits (PROs) with minimal thrust expenditure in the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) linearized orbit dynamics <span class=\"highlight\">system</span>, provably optimal algorithms have been developed. But these provably optimal algorithms fail to generalize in a multitude of ways.

This package contains the BON2020 model.

Although subsequent studies showed the model to be reasonably accurate for such applications, modifications to the sunspot number (SSN) classification <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> and a large number of new highprecision measurements suggested the need to develop an improved and more capable model. The new BON2020 model relies on daily integral flux from the Advanced Composition Explorer Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (ACE/CRIS) to describe solar activity.

Parameters in the new model are calibrated to available data, which include the new Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS02) and Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Lightnuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) highprecision measurements. It is found that the BON2020 model is a significant improvement over BON2014. Systematic bias associated with BON2014 has been removed. The average relative error of the BON2020 model compared to all available measurements is found to be <1%, and BON2020 is found to be within 15% of a large fraction of the available measurements (26,269 of 27,646  95%).",

      "The Phenological Parameters Estimation Tool (PPET) is a set of algorithms implemented in MATLAB that estimates key vegetative phenological parameters. For a given year, the PPET software package takes in temporally processed vegetation index data (3-D spatio-temporal arrays) generated by the Time Series Product Tool (TSPT) and outputs spatial grids (2-D arrays) of vegetation phenological parameters. As a precursor to PPET, the TSPT uses quality information for each pixel of each date to remove bad or suspect data, and then interpolates and digitally filters the time series to produce a continuous, smoothed vegetation index product in which data voids are eliminated. Both the TSPT and PPET use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite multi-spectral data as a default, but each software package is easily modifiable and could be used with any high-temporal-rate remote sensing <span class=\"highlight\">system</span> that is capable of producing vegetation indices.Unlike other known plant phenological parameter estimation software, the PPET produces not only common phenological parameters but also real-time and custom parameters without a priori assumptions about the shape of the phenological cycle. Common phenological parameters, like those produced in PPET, are associated with the annual vegetation growth cycle.  They quantitatively describe vegetative states related to annual cyclical growing seasons, such as green-up, maturity, senescence, and dormancy, by analyzing the temporal shape of given vegetation index time series. The real-time phenological and custom parameters are formed from a cumulative sum (integral) produced at a fixed temporal interval. In addition, a cumulative vegetation index and time-specific/pest-specific phenological parameters can be designed to optimize the detection of vegetation damage from specific pests and diseases. These problem-specific phenological parameters have the potential to be integrated into near real-time, predictive surveillance systems (i.e. early warning systems) and, with improved vegetative state information, could assist decision makers in making intelligent vegetation and associated land resource management choices.MATLAB, MATLAB Runtime Library and ERDAS IMAGINE are required to run the software.",

The model is built upon the previously released Advanced Geared Turbofan 30,000lbf (AGTF30). The model was constructed with the Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) within the MATLAB/Simulink Coding environment. The engine model is based upon the same NASA N+3 concept as the original AGTF30. It features a compact core and a variable area fan nozzle. The AGTF30-e has several features that can be leveraged to carryout numerous studies with respect to electrification. The model can represent a conventional engine or a mild hybrid that includes some electrified features. The model can also represent boost operation, which defines thrust augmentation over key mission segments. The final primary operating mode is power extraction, in which a significant amount of power is extracted from the engine shafts to produce thrust elsewhere on the airframe. In addition, there are options to enable additional features such as electric power transfer (EPT) to enhance performance at low engine power levels, and Turbine Electrified Energy Management (TEEM) to improve transient operability and alleviate dynamically driven design constraints.  Finally, the model can implement two methods of engine and electric machine integration. One method provides a baseline through integrating electric machines with each engine shaft. The other method reflects the Versatile Electrically Augmented Turbine Engine (VEATE) gearbox approach and couples the two engine shafts though a planetary gearbox that can be used to manipulate power transfer through the electromechanical powertrain.",

The analysis provides a high-fidelity modeling of subsonic, transonic and supersonic flow regimes with attached and separated flow fields. The code calculates performance quantities such as efficiency, mass flow, pressure ratio, temperature ratio, distribution of flowfield properties in the entire domain of calculation, aerodynamic damping to assess flutter stabiltiy and unsteady aerodynamic forces arising from rotor-stator interaction for calculation of forced response. This information can be used in high cycle fatigue analysis of blade rows.",

Exposure to the solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) present cancer risks to astronauts.  The NASA Johnson Space Center Space Radiation Program (<span class=\"highlight\">JSC</span>-SRP) has developed the NASA Space Radiation Cancer Risk (NSCR) model to estimate cancer risks  and overall uncertainties due to various factors that enter into risk estimates.  NSCR utilizes the latest analysis of human radio-epidemiology for low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and cancer and survival rates in the U.S. population and a population of never-smokers. NASA specific radiation quality factors based on particle track structure are defined.  Models of space environments and  radiation transport are used to determine organ exposures behind spacecraft shielding.  NSCR makes projections for never-smokers which are shown to lead to reduced radiation cancer risk compared to others. NSCR uses Monte-Carlo propopagation of errors in various factors that enter into risk projections to determine overall uncertainties in radiation cancer projections. The NSCR Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides seamless integration of input and output manipulations, which are required for operations of the sub-modules: HZETRN, BRYNTRN, SUMSHIELD, and the Cancer probabilistic response models. The main applications envisioned are International Space Station (ISS) Missions, and planning for future exploration missions to the moon, Near Earth Objects (NEO) or Mars.  Tissues specific probabilities for cancer incidence or death are evaluated for various criteria including: 1) adults at different ages of exposures, 2) males or females, and 3) population of never-smokers or the US average population. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) are used to describe factor uncertainties, and 95% confidence levels estimated.",

This technique uses transfer learning from classification models that were pretrained on the massive microscopy image database from the NASA ASG lab. Experiments show that transferring the features learned from pretraining on large microscopy datasets to segmentation tasks leads to accurate segmentation models with significantly less training data and the models generalize to unseen data better. This is significant because training data for segmentation tasks is expensive and in limited availability and this technique reduces the required training data. In addition, the labeled training data cannot account for all possible imaging and sample conditions that the model should be expected to perform accurately on, and experiments showed that this technique improves model accuracy on data outside the training distribution. Developing accurate segmentation models is significant because it is the first and hardest step in automatically quantifying microstructure features which is critical to linking the processing-<span class=\"highlight\">structure</span>-property relationships of materials.

The Monte Carlo analysis, called Orbital Lifetime Monte Carlo (OLMC), is based on the <span class=\"highlight\">NASA</span> Langley Research Center long term orbit propagator Orbital Lifetime. OLMC incorporates the ability to model variations in predictions of solar flux levels and timing of associated peaks, the variation in launch vehicle orbit insertion accuracy (altitude, velocity, and flight path angles), spacecraft ballistic coefficients, and launch delays. Desired repeatability, distribution smoothness and code runtime are considered for the purposes of establishing values for code specific parameters and number of Monte Carlo runs. Results demonstrate that solar flux predictions are the primary driver for variations in lifetime; of which, due to their variability, multiple prediction sets should be utilized to fully characterize the lifetime range of a spacecraft.",

A considerable amount of GSE is designed by the Launch Vehicle and Spacecraft developers for KSC use during the ground processing flow.  Additionally, KSC develops GSE for use during processing, launch preparation, and launch activities.  All GSE used at KSC during the processing flow is tracked and identified during ground operations planning activities.  The Ground Operations Planning Database (GOPDb) provides the application to coordinate the various aspects of the ground planning phase.  Additional rigor and visibility into the GSE component of ground operations planning is critical to a seamless and cost effective planning and design phase.  An integrated GSE tracking solution must be developed to provide visibility, accountability, and configuration control of GSE data to all stakeholders while ensuring that the source data remains appropriately controlled and protected.  This  integrated GSE tracking and management tool  the Ground Hardware Management Tool (GHMT)  Application - for tracking and managing GSE data used in support of KSC\\GSDO operations planning and launch campaigns.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the study time period is calculated and then compared to the maximum and minimum NDVI from a baseline range of years in order to calculate Relative Greenness (RG). The change in RG from the previous year is found, and this allows the user to identify abrupt change in vegetation. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and USDA Croplands Dataset have been added as additional datasets that can help establish if the change was caused by a fire or by a change in crop type. Recent available NAIP imagery for the study area is also included, as an example of what is available for high resolution imagery within GEE.  Based on a date input by the user, the map viewer displays the RG, the change in RG, the percent change in RG, and the NBR, along with the Cropland layer from that year and NAIP imagery taken closest in time to the requested display date.
