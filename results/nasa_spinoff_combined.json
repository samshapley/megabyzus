      "Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) are high technology silicon chips that connect light directly into electronic or digital images, which can be manipulated or enhanced by computers. When Goddard Space Flight Center (<span class=\"highlight\">GSFC</span>) scientists realized that existing CCD technology could not meet scientific requirements for the Hubble Space Telescope Imagining Spectrograph, <span class=\"highlight\">GSFC</span> contracted with Scientific Imaging Technologies, Inc. (SITe) to develop an advanced CCD. SITe then applied many of the NASA-driven enhancements to the manufacture of CCDs for digital mammography. The resulting device images breast tissue more clearly and efficiently. The LORAD Stereo Guide Breast Biopsy system incorporates SITe&apos;s CCD as part of a digital camera system that is replacing surgical biopsy in many cases. Known as stereotactic needle biopsy, it is performed under local anesthesia with a needle and saves women time, pain, scarring, radiation exposure and money.",

      "The Force-Balanced Piston Gauge (FPG) tests and calibrates instrumentation operating in the low pressure range. In 1994, Kennedy Space Center needed for an easy-to-use, low-pressure, primary standard to support the calibration of instrumentation for the International Space Station. DHI developed the FPG for Kennedy&apos;s Metrology Laboratory. The system provides a traceable, primary calibration standard for measuring pressures in the range of near 0 to 15 kPa (2.2 psi) in both gauge and absolute measurement modes. The hardware combines a large area piston-cylinder with a load cell measuring the force resulting from pressures across the piston. The mass of the piston can be tared out, allowing measurement to start from zero. A pressure higher than the measured pressure, which keeps the piston centered, lubricates an innovative conical gap located between the piston and the cylinder, eliminating the need for piston rotation. A pressure controller based on the control of low gas flow automates the pressure control. DHI markets the FPG as an automated primary standard for very low-gauge and absolute pressures. DHI is selling the FPG to high-end metrology laboratories on a case by case basis, with a full commercial release to follow. The FPG has applications in aerospace, semiconductor manufacturing, nuclear fuel processing, and pharmaceuticals.",

      "Dr. Mark Rosekind led NASA&apos;s Fatigue Countermeasures Program from 1990 until 1997. During his tenure, he made many important contributions to applied research, accident investigation, aviation policy, and operational environments. In 1997, Rosekind brought his expertise to the private sector by founding Alertness Solutions, Inc., a scientific consulting firm that translates knowledge of sleep, circadian rhythms, alertness, and performance into practical products, services, and strategies that improve safety and productivity. These offerings are geared towards individuals and organizations involved with around-the-clock operations, altered shift schedules, sustained or continuous requirements, and frequent travel across time zones. In 2005, Cupertino, California-based Alertness Solutions added another NASA fatigue countermeasures veteran to the mix, when Dr. Melissa Mallis, who led the Fatigue Countermeasures Group from 2000 to 2005, joined the company as its director of scientific affairs. While with NASA, Mallis had made significant contributions to safety, research, and education in aviation, space, and other diverse operational settings. Together, Rosekind and Mallis are applying the scientific prowess they honed at Ames and incorporating the latest research available to help individuals and organizations manage and overcome the operational challenges of their environments. Such challenges include drowsy driving that occurs from long durations behind the wheel, jet lag from crossing multiple time zones in a short period of time, and sleep deprivation resulting from irregular schedules and challenging sleep environments. One of the company&apos;s solutions is a product called Awake at the Wheel, which includes a 32-page alertness guide and a 36-minute audio CD to give drivers: information about what makes them sleepy and how this affects their ability to drive safely; ways to accurately evaluate their alertness; sure-fire&quot; strategies to help them stay alert; and planning tools that allow them to implement alertness strategies on the next big trip.&quot;",

Today, Parker is supplying the huge valves that control propellant flow from the Space Shuttle&apos;s external fuel tank to the engines of the Shuttle Orbiter as well as the peanut valve named for its small size. In 1977, NASA, recognizing the company&apos;s special expertise in miniature systems, asked Parker to participate in the development of an implantable artificial sphincter for control of urinary incontinence. The company&apos;s peanut valve experience provided an ideal base for a new biomedical project, the Programmable Implantable Medication System (PIMS) for continuous, computer-directed delivery of precisely metered medication  -- insulin, for example  --  within a patient&apos;s body. The work on PIMS also inspired development of Micromed, a related programmable medication device for external, rather than implantable use. The Biomedical Products Division has also applied its fluid handling expertise to a drugless therapy system called Cryomax for the treatment of such disorders as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",

First requisite for preserving the structure is identification of the nature of contaminants. A non-invasive&quot; technique based on space technology has been developed and tested. It employs a neutron source and a gamma ray detector. Placed on one side of the wall to be examined the source fires neutrons created by the decay of a radioactive isotope. As they pass through the wall the neutrons collide with atoms and the atoms depending on their type emit various kinds of gamma rays. These rays are identified by the gamma ray detector on the other side of the wall. Energy of the rays shows the kind of element present. The intensity level indicates the quantity. Composition of the contaminants within the walls is determined by a multichannel analyzer.&quot;",

Thus was born Florida&apos;s massive Mapping and Monitoring of Agricultural Lands Project (MMALP). It employs data from the NASA-developed Landsat Earth resources survey satellite system as a quicker, less expensive alternative to ground surveying. The 3 year project involved inventory of Florida&apos;s 36 million acres classifying such as cropland, pastureland, citrus, woodlands, wetland, water and populated areas. Direction was assigned to Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) with assistance from the DOT.

Biogasses created by the anaerobically decomposing trash are necessary to fulfill the energy needs of this revolutionary greenhouse. The primary emission, methane, is piped to the greenhouse boiler and used to fuel the hot water heating system. Thus far, the use of biogas has drastically reduced the operating costs of the greenhouse, eliminating the need for non-renewable fuels. The biogas will also generate electricity for the greenhouse in the near future. The plants are irrigated with recycled plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These nutrients are delivered through hydroponics, the cultivation of plants in a nutrient solution rather than in soil. High-pressure sodium lamps augment the natural light, thereby boosting production and reducing cropping time. A total of 16 hours of light are provided to the crop each day, year-round. It only takes about 90 days for a seed to germinate and produce a tomato harvest. Not only is the food produced faster, the manual labor needed for the upkeep of the plants is also drastically reduced.",

With 16 years of NASA experience, the technician teamed up with another NASA colleague and formed PROSystems, Inc., of Sharpsburg, Maryland, to provide the optics community with an alternative source for precision hollow retroreflectors. The company&apos;s hollow retroreflectors are front surface glass substrates assembled to provide many advantages over existing hollow retroreflectors and solid glass retroreflectors. Previous to this new technology, some companies chose not to use hollow retroreflectors due to large seam widths and loss of signal. The tongue and groove&quot; facet design of PROSystems&apos;s retroreflector allows for an extremely small seam width of .001 inches.

      "NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense jointly commissioned the research and development of a technology solution to address the challenges and requirements of communicating with their spacecraft. The project yielded a broad suite of protocols specifically designed for space-based communications, known as Space Communications Protocol Standards (SCPS). Engineers from Global Science &amp; Technology, Inc. (GST), were the principal developers of the SCPS suite of protocols. GST commercialized the transport protocol component of the SCPS suite, which had been developed through funding by NASA&apos;s Goddard Space Flight Center at the start of the original research and development project. This funding was critical in building the reference implementation that served as the blueprint for what eventually would become SkipWare,R the commercial implementation of the SCPS transport protocol. Global Protocols, Inc., distributes SkipWare as a software license and as an embedded service on the hardware platforms of Comtech EF Data. SkipWare mitigates or eliminates the obstacles associated with wireless and satellite transport and provides efficient, reliable transmission over these media. The technology has been sold to customers in the satellite, terrestrial wireless, and wireless telemetry markets.",

      "Responding to a need for improved data collection for remote atmospheric measurement systems, ASRC Aerospace Corporation developed a series of low-power, highly integrated, multi-channel scaler (MCS) cards. The cards, designed to meet the needs of NASA&apos;s ground-based and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) photon-counting programs, can rapidly collect thousands of data points during a continuous scan of the atmosphere. Using Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding from NASA&apos;s Goddard Space Flight Center, ASRC Aerospace improved upon its Advanced Multi-channel Scaler-5 card, which was already utilized in several Goddard-led projects. The MCS cards can be used in pulse-counting, integrating, and histogramming applications. They have been sold worldwide for use in advanced, high repetition-rate LIDAR systems, and can be used in environmental monitoring data systems that study everything from clouds to aerosols to pollution. The military could adapt the MCS cards for its smoke and chemical plume detection systems. The cards could also be used in non-LIDAR applications such as those for nuclear waste detection monitoring.",

The C-C composites are very lightweight and exceptionally strong and stiff, even at very high temperatures. The composites have been used in industrial heating applications, the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as in glass manufacturing and on semiconductors. Applications also include transfer components for glass manufacturing and structural members for carrier support in semiconductor processing.",

Sturman&apos;s work resulted in multiple patents and systems that were extensively used by NASA, including a valve that helped power the Apollo spacecraft. Sturman&apos;s digital valve&quot; consists of a specially designed spool with a magnetic holding and releasing mechanism on its side and two opposing electromagnetic coils. The magnetic holding and releasing is commanded by sophisticated electronic processors causing the spool to pass back and forth at tremendous speeds with remarkable precision to ensure accurate control of the pressurized hydraulic fluid that is pumped through the valve&apos;s opening. This allows the digital valve to open and shut extremely fast. Additionally the valve can remain in the desired open/closed position due to magnetism from the component&apos;s electromagnetic coils. In effect it saves energy provides far greater fuel economy and generates much less pollution than comparative valves. Sturman formed his own company Sturman Industries in 1989 to commercialize the digital valve for non-<span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> use. From the digital valve Sturman created a Hydraulic Valve Actuation system that provides the flexibility and precision required for clean practical and safe &quot;camless&quot; engine technology.&quot;",

The coated glass shields spacecraft instruments from cosmic radiation and protects human vision from unfiltered sunlight in space. Because the coating process allows some wavelengths of light and color to reflect and others to pass through, a chameleon effect is produced. Murray Schwartz, a former <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> engineer, has based his business KROMA on this NASA optical technology. He produces dichroic stained glass windows, mobiles and jewelry. The technique involves deposition of superthin layers of metal oxides applied one layer at a time in a specific order and thickness for the desired effect.

      "In the midst of developing battery-free, solar-powered refrigeration and air conditioning systems for habitats in space, David Bergeron, the team leader for NASA&apos;s Advanced Refrigerator Technology Team at Johnson Space Center, acknowledged the need for a comparable solar refrigerator that could operate in conjunction with the simple lighting systems already in place on Earth. Bergeron, a 20-year veteran in the <span class=\"highlight\">aerospace</span> industry, founded the company Solus Refrigeration, Inc., in 1999, to take the patented advanced refrigeration technology developed by he and his teammate, Johnson engineer Michael Ewert, to commercial markets. Now known as SunDanze Refrigeration, Inc., Bergeron&apos;s company is producing battery-free, PV refrigeration systems under license to NASA, and selling them globally. Designed to function in arid to semi-arid regions with at least 5 sun-hours per day, the PV direct-drive, or PV direct SunDanzer solar refrigerator is a chest-type cabinet with a 105-liter (3.7 cubic feet) internal volume, a lockable top-opening door, a corrosion-resistant coated steel exterior, and a patented low-frost system. The solar refrigerator&apos;s thermal storage material provides 7 days of reserve cold storage, even in tropical climates, or during extensive periods of cloudy weather when sunlight is not available for energy production.",

The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut. Kennedy Space Center provided AI Technologies with information about NASA&apos;s torque wrench tool adapter through a royalty-free, public domain technology transfer agreement.

Durable and portable Fastorque is especially suited for hard-to-reach places and saves time in disconnect/connect procedures for troubleshooting connectors. AI Technologies believes the tool is a good alternative to conventional spanner wrenches which can be unwieldy and difficult to use especially in places allowing little clearance for the wrench to rotate. While Fastorque allows for the full rotation of spanner nuts in places with minimum clearance conventional spanner wrenches in tight spots can cause damage as the user tightens the nuts or withdraws the wrench.

The Langley ESP measurement system was based on miniature integrated circuit pressure-sensing transducers that communicated pressure information to a minicomputer. In 1977, Juanarena formed PSI to exploit the NASA technology. In 1978 he left Langley, obtained a NASA license for the technology, introduced the first commercial product, the 780B pressure measurement system. PSI developed a pressure scanner for automation of industrial processes. Now in its second design generation, the DPT-6400 is capable of making 2,000 measurements a second and has 64 channels by addition of slave units. New system 8400 represents PSI&apos;s bid to further exploit the $600 million U.S. industrial pressure measurement market.

      "Attempting to locate a malfunctioning wire in a complex bundle of wires or in a cable that is concealed behind a wall is as difficult as trying to find a needle in a haystack. The result of such an effort can also be costly, time-consuming, and frustrating, whether it is the tedious process of examining cable connections for the Space Shuttle or troubleshooting a cable television hookup. Furthermore, other maintenance restrictions can compound the effort required to locate and repair a particular wiring problem. For example, on the Space Shuttle, once a repair is completed, all systems that have a wire passing through any of the connectors that were disconnected during troubleshooting are affected and, therefore, must undergo retesting, an arduous task that is completely unrelated to the original problem. In an effort to streamline wire inspection and maintenance, two contractors supporting NASA&apos;s Kennedy Space Center invented the Standing Wave Reflectometer (SWR) in 1999. Eclypse International Corp., further developed the SWR for use outside of NASA. The resulting technology is currently being used to test wires and cables in complex vehicle systems, and has the potential for myriad consumer-driven applications, as it features a menu-driven interface simple enough for a novice to use.

Computer design involves creation of a mathematical model of a product and analyzing its effectiveness in simulated operation. Technique enables study of performance and structural behavior of a number of different designs before settling on a final configuration. Wolverine employees attacked a traditional brake drum problem, the sudden buildup of heat during fast and repeated braking. Part of brake drum not confined tends to change its shape under combination of heat, physical pressure and rotational forces -- a condition known as bellmouthing. Since bellmouthing is a major factor in braking effectiveness, a solution of problem would be a major advance in automotive engineering. A former NASA employee, now a Wolverine employee, knew of a series of NASA computer programs ideally suited to confronting bellmouthing. Originally developed as aids to rocket engine nozzle design, it is capable of analyzing problems generated in a rocket engine or automotive brake drum by heat, expansion, pressure and rotational forces. Use of these computer programs led to new brake drum concept featuring a more durable axle, and heat transfer ribs, or fins, on hub of  drum.  Wolverine now incorporates these parts in complete high quality chassis for a variety of automotive applications:  for military command, control and communications centers; for intelligence vehicles; and for multipurpose vehicles that can be airlifted on military transports. In civil sector, Wolverine chassis are used in buses, recreational vehicles and delivery trucks; also sold as turnkey medical diagnostic facilities.",

      "In 1984, NASA initiated the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) program to test two unverified predictions of Albert Einstein&apos;s theory of general relativity.To test these predictions, the Space Agency and researchers at Stanford University developed an experiment that would check, with extreme precision, tiny changes in the spin direction of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at a 400-mile altitude directly over the Earth&apos;s poles. The researchers assessed using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to control the attitude of the GP-B spacecraft accurately. At that time, the best GPS receivers could only provide accuracy to nearly 1 meter, but the GP-B spacecraft required a system 100 times more accurate. They created new technologies, then branched out, testing the new Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS technology. The thinking of the researchers shifted again from automatically landing aircraft, to automating precision farming and construction equipment. A group of the Stanford researchers in Menlo Park, California, created their own company, Novariant Corporation (originally called IntegriNautics Corporation), and submitted a proposal to NASA&apos;s Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program at Langley Research Center. In partnership with NASA, the FAA, and Stanford, the firm planned to research and develop a highly reliable navigations system for precision approach and landing,  using <span class=\"highlight\">navigation</span> signals transmitted by satellites and similar signals transmitted by low-cost &apos;Integrity Beacons&apos; on the ground.&quot; The STTR contract had also identified other potential applications,  including commercial ones for automated agricultural and construction equipment. In 1996,  Novariant spawned a subsidiary,  AutoFarm,  to focus on agricultural applications of its GPS auto-steering technology,  and a tractor-steering technology was trademarked with the name RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) AutoSteer. RTK AutoSteer was released in 1999 to farmers in California, Arizona, and Australia.",

The three entities worked together to establish a multifaceted testing program that utilizes an XRF-detectable soil media that can be quantified after a carpet cleaning, to measure the effectiveness of a given cleaning system. This designer soil&quot; contains properties similar to soil found in carpeting throughout the country according to CRI. Using the commercial spinoff tool called the TRACeR III-V scanner laboratories can measure the starting compound applied to a carpet sample and then quantify the precise amount of soil removed following a cleaning. The scanner can additionally be used to determine the amount of water being removed from a carpet during a cleaning in the event of a spill or if a wet-vac had been used. To measure how well an extractor (vacuum cleaner) recovers water a carpet sample is weighed before and after the testing process to determine how much water remained. The XRF testing also evaluates surface-appearance changes in carpeting as a result of vacuuming. This test is included because experience has shown that some extraction machines can cause excessive wear on carpet according to CRI.&quot;",

Due to technical problems with the vehicle&apos;s composite liquid hydrogen tanks, the X-33 program was cancelled in February 2001. Science developed for the vehicle prototype helped toward creating a small fiber-optic-based temperature sensor that has found widespread uses. In 1996, Systems and Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC), of Austin, Texas, undertook a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Langley Research Center to develop the compact and lightweight digital thermal sensing (DTS) system for monitoring the cryogenic tanks on the X-33 prototype aircraft. That technology, along with a processor developed by SPEC for Goddard Space Flight Center, was space-qualified and integrated into several NASA missions. SPEC formed an ancillary organization, SensorTran, Inc., to continue work developing the DTS technology for a variety of commercial and industrial applications. By the year 2000, SensorTran was employing the DTS technology around the world in the oil and gas industry, the electrical power industry, in processing plants, and to test structural integrity of large structures.

Hartford&apos;s parent company, Acoustic Emission Technology Corporation (AET) refined and commercialized the technology. The IBA builds on the original system and incorporates on-line process control systems. The IBA determines bond strength by measuring changes in pulsar ultrasonic waves injected into a board. Analysis of the wave determines the average internal bond strength for the panel. Results are displayed immediately. Using the system, a mill operator can adjust resin/wood proportion, reduce setup time and waste, produce internal bonds of a consistent quality and automatically mark deficient products.",

Unlike a hearing aid, which just makes sounds louder, the cochlear implant selects speech signal information and then produces a pattern of electrical pulses in a patient&apos;s ear. A microphone picks up sounds and transmits them to a speech processor that converts them into digital signals. In 1977, NASA helped Kissiah obtain a patent for the cochlear implant.

      "An umbilical&quot; is a large <span class=\"highlight\">device</span> that transports power communications instrument readings and fluids such as propellants pressurization gasses and coolants from one source to another. Numerous launch vehicles planetary systems and rovers require umbilical &quot;mating.&quot; This process is a driving factor for dependable and affordable space access. With future-generation space vehicles in mind NASA recently designed a smart automated method for quickly and reliably mating and demating electrical and fluid umbilical connectors. The new umbilical concept is expected to replace NASA&apos;s traditional umbilical systems that release at vehicle lift-off. The idea is to increase safety by automatically performing hazardous tasks thus reducing potential failure modes and the time and labor hours necessary to prepare for launch. Under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Kennedy Space Center Rohwedder Inc. successfully commercialized the Smart Remote Umbilical Mating System (SRUMS) based on NASA&apos;s next-generation umbilical technology. SRUMS is one of the most advanced fueling systems available in today&apos;s market as it decreases the need for human intervention during potentially dangerous fueling operations. Applications include the individual and gang mating of launch vehicles as well as commercial aircraft.&quot;",

      "In early 2000, Glenn Research Center asked Western DataCom Co., Inc., to develop an IP router so that NASA could better secure its communications with orbiting satellites. This was part of NASA&apos;s IP in Space&quot; initiative which looked to employ commercial off-the-shelf products to support reliable fast and secure communications. The company signed a Space Act Agreement with Glenn and delivered a prototype <span class=\"highlight\">device</span> that met the requirements set by the NASA research center. In 2004 a commercial secure mobile router system that was spun off from this work was successfully used by the Army for an AeroStat (balloon)-based radar called the Persistent Threat Detection System in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The system permits military technical operations centers (TOCs) in Iraq to send secure high-speed voice video and data communications to the field through mobile units tactically deployed. This was the first use during war of technology enabling TOCs and mobile units to send secure voice video and data communications according to Western DataCom.

Typically 50 to 100 &quot;mouses&quot; are installed throughout a city&apos;s sewer system.  Each provides a water depth reading every 15 minutes around the clock. Every few days field crews collect the stored data form the recorders and transfer it to a central computer for processing and evaluation. System does not pinpoint specific leaks.

      "Nicknamed the ice zapper the Electro Expulsive Separation System (EESS) is an aircraft ice removal system that pulverizes ice and removes layers of ice as thin as frost or as thick as an inch of glaze according to the principle inventor of the technology. Patented by NASA&apos;s Ames Research Center, the EESS consists of layers of conductors encased in materials that are bonded directly to the airframe structure. When ice accumulates on the aircraft, an electric current is sent through the conductors, causing them to pulse. Even though the conductors move less than a twenty-thousandth of an inch in just a millisecond, the movement is sufficient to pulverize the ice. It is this highly accelerated motion that shatters the ice into particles the size of table salt; too small to be harmful to the aircraft.  When compared with other systems in use, such as thermal deicers and pneumatic boots, the ice zapper does very well. Thermal deicers are fairly common, although they use an enormous amount of energy and present the possibility of ice refreezing. Pneumatic boots are not always effective because they require an inflation <span class=\"highlight\">device</span> that is unable to work until a quarter inch of ice has accumulated. With both systems, the ice that is loosened may still be large enough to cause problems for the plane once dislodged.",

      "In 1994, David Mansbery was at the helm of an active family whose schedule rarely allowed for home-cooked meals. Growing tired of frequent fast-food dinners, Mansbery set out to bring traditional, home-cooked dinners back into his home. At the time, Mansbery was president of a natural gas supply company, and Glenn Research Center was one of his biggest clients. When Mansbery pitched his idea of a hot-and-cold, remotely operated oven to Glenn, the NASA center lined him up with a group of its engineers that had worked on the ISS Electric Power System, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) that studied the Sun, the Cassini spacecraft that is currently visiting Saturn, and several experiments that flew on the Space Shuttle. These engineers supplied Mansbery with Embedded Web Technology&quot; software that was developed at Glenn in 1996. According to its inventors Embedded Web Technology marries embedded systems (hardware or software that forms a component of a larger system and is expected to operate without human intervention) and the World Wide Web to let a user monitor and/or control a remote <span class=\"highlight\">device</span> with an embedded system over the Internet using a convenient interface. Embedded Web Technology allows astronauts to operate experiments from anywhere on the ISS using any laptop computer available to them. With authorization to use the Embedded Web Technology Mansbery formed the TMIO company to execute his idea. The NASA software enabled low-cost real-time remote control and monitoring of the resulting intelligent oven product ConnectIo. With combined cooling and heating capabilities TMIO&apos;s ConnectIo stainless-steel professional series oven provides convenience for today&apos;s active lifestyles. Before leaving for work consumers can place cold food in ConnectIo where it will remain properly refrigerated until a programmable cooking cycle begins; the oven is preprogrammed with a universal cooking menu which can be customized to the user&apos;s preferences. The menu allows the user to simply enter the dinner time and the oven automatically switches from refrigeration to the cooking cycle so that the meal will be ready as the family arrives home for dinner.&quot;",

      "NASA has been working with Ophir Corporation, of Littleton, Colorado, since 1985 on a variety of remote optical sensing projects. Most of this work has been in the form of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants. In the 1990s, Ophir&apos;s work with NASA shifted from the weather-related sensors it had been developing to remote sensing instrumentation to measure temperature, humidity, and airspeed. The resulting measurements could be used to improve flight safety.  From 2002 to 2004, Ophir worked under new SBIR Phase I and II contracts with Dryden Flight Research Center to provide proof-of-concept laboratory testing of a new approach to Optical Air Data Systems (OADS). Traditionally, air data is measured with several probes that are mounted on an <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span>, including immersion temperature probes and Pitot airspeed probes, as well as with flush-mounted static pressure ports. In this project and in a follow-on effort, Ophir addressed the problem of determining the characteristics of the air outside of the boundary layer of an <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span>. This development included the use of a single sensor to replace the conventional air data sensors that are prone to such failures as icing and the plugging of Pitot tubes. An optical air data sensor now provides the potential for important benefits to high-performance <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span>. These include measurements in difficult <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> attitudes, potentially higher update rate, and reduced calibration and maintenance costs.",

      "<span class=\"highlight\">Aircraft</span> Belts, Inc. (ABI), of Kemah, Texas, was looking for a way to ensure the safety of its customers by developing a thorough test system for aviation restraint systems. Previous safety restraint test methods did not properly measure the load distribution placed on the restraints, leaving an unknown factor in meeting safety standards. ABI needed to improve its testing methods and update its test equipment. Through a partnership with NASA&apos;s Johnson Space Center Technical Outreach Program, the need was met. With the assistance of NASA engineers, ABI developed a hydraulic test system that provides the consumer with in-depth data about the load placed on the restraint system throughout the duration of the test. The old systems were only able to detect if the belts could sustain the applied force and could not target the problem of providing load data. In comparison, the new system modeled after the one used by NASA, can collect data that tells exactly what went wrong with belts that break and why. Depending on the test requirements of various restraint components, the system can exert a subjected force ranging from merely a few pounds to thousands. The test force can be applied to an entire safety restraint system or to its individual parts, including, stitching, webbing, and harware.",

      "Ames Research Center teamed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to study human performance factors associated with the use of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance system (TCAS II) in an operational environment. TCAS is designed to alert pilots of the presence of other <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> in their vicinity, to identify and track those who could be a threat, and to recommend action to avoid a collision. Ames conducted three laboratory experiments. The first showed that pilots were able to use the TCAS II correctly in the allowable time. The second tested pilots&apos; response to changes in the avoidance advisories, and the third examined pilots&apos; reactions to alternative displays. After a 1989 congressional mandate, the FAA ruled that TCAS would be required on all passenger carrying <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> (to be phased in completely by 1995).",

Dynamic Systems founder Charles Yost created an open-cell, polymeric memory&quot; foam material with unusual viscoelastic properties; that is it possessed both high-energy absorption and soft characteristics. Ames Research Center fit this cushion-like material into a new airplane seat design that not only offered better impact protection in the event of an accident but enhanced passenger comfort on long flights. Today temper foam is branching out far from its original applications to absorb shock and provide an added element of safety in NASCAR Formula 1 Champion Auto Racing Team (CART) and Indy Racing League racecars; motorcycle and horseback saddles; amusement park rides; and military and civilian <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span>. The technology has even been incorporated into archery targets full-sized body casts for custom-clothing design and human and animal prostheses.",

      "The low plasticity burnishing (LPB) process produces a deep layer of surface compression in a quick and affordable manner to produce metal surfaces free of scratches, nicks, and gouges. The process, designed for easy inclusion in the manufacturing environment, can be performed with conventional Computer Numerical Control machine tools. This allows parts to be processed during manufacturing, rather than as a post process in a separate facility. A smooth, free-rolling spherical ball suspended in a fluid allows for single-point contact. The ball comes into mechanical contact only with the surface to be burnished, and can be moved in any direction. LPB can be applied to all types of carbon and alloy steel, stainless steel, cast iron, aluminum, titanium, and nickel-based super alloys. In addition to improving a surface&apos;s resistance to fatigue and damage, treatment stops the growth of shallow cracks. The LPB process is used on the leading edges of turbine blades to improve resistance to foreign object damage and crack growth. This means significant savings for <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span> owners, since maintenance requirements to inspect for fatigue damage, replace parts, and remove corrosion damage increase the cost of operation.",

      "Built and designed by Avco Corporation, the Apollo heat shield was coated with an ablative material whose purpose was to burn and, thus, dissipate energy. The burned material charred to form a protective coating which blocked heat penetration beyond the outer surface. Avco Corporation subsequently entered into a contract with Ames Research Center to develop spinoff applications of the heat shield in the arena of fire protection, specifically for the development of fire-retardant paints and foams for <span class=\"highlight\">aircraft</span>. This experience led to the production of Chartek 59, manufactured by Avco Specialty Materials (a subsidiary of Avco Corporation eventually acquired by Textron, Inc.) and marketed as the world&apos;s first intumescent epoxy material. As an intumescent coating, Chartek 59 expanded in volume when exposed to heat or flames and acted as an insulating barrier. It also retained its space-age ablative properties and dissipated heat through burn-off. In 1999, Houston-based International Paint, LLC, acquired the Chartek fireproofing brand. The company&apos;s latest product derived from Chartek technology is coined Interchar and geared toward making America&apos;s high-rise buildings and public structures safer. Interchar swells to provide a tough and stable insulating layer over the steel to protect it. An Interchar coating is typically applied at a thickness between 1 and 8 millimeters, so it does not impact the overall shape of the steel. Because this is a thin layering process, architects and building planners can still explore intricate and innovate architectural designs, especially when the steel is exposed. Interchar offers fast cure times, superior adhesion to steel surfaces, and a strong, durable barrier to the steel beam underneath. Altogether, these attributes provide up to 4 hours of fire protection and help prevent steel infrastructures from collapsing prematurely, in turn, giving building occupants more time to evacuate safely.",

The coating is applied usually by spray gun to exterior structural steel conduits, pipes and valves, offshore platforms and liquefied petroleum gas tanks. Fireproofing provides two types of protection: ablation or dissipation of heat by burnoff and intumescence&quot; or swelling; the coating swells to about five times its original size forming a protective blanket of char which retards transfer of heat to the metal structure preventing loss of structural strength and possible collapse which would compound the fire fighting problem.&quot;",

The &quot;Wave Shaft&quot; golf shaft employs a viscoelastic layer sandwiched in between two opposing wavy-patterned graphite layers to create unparalleled stiffness and damping.

      "PETI-5 is the commonly used term for phenylethynyl terminated imide oligomers, and the 5 refers to the fifth formulation out of 200 compositions. It is a chemical material that can be used as both a resin and an adhesive. Prepared from commercially available materials, PETI-5 combines superb mechanical properties and extreme durability with easy processing and environmental stability. For example, the material has temperature capabilities of 350 ?F for a lifetime of around 60,000 hours. Curing is done with the application of heat and mild pressure, which results in the formation of a strong, resistant polymer. Due to its unique combination of benefits, PETI-5 will be used in the development of the high speed civil transport (HSCT), a concept 300-passenger commercial plane that will travel at a speed of Mach 2.4. Because currently available metals are too heavy and cannot withstand the extreme high temperatures resulting from flying at such high speeds, <span class=\"highlight\">composite</span> materials made from graphite fibers and PETI-5 are necessary.

In February 2003, Johnson Space Center recognized the promise of this technology and began working with Zyvex through a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to develop the rational engineering of carbon nanotube surface chemistry. In the Phase I program, Zyvex not only demonstrated the ability to make high-concentration solutions of carbon nanotubes in organic solvents, but also demonstrated the ability to achieve excellent dispersion of the carbon nanotubes in polymers such as epoxy. These successes led to a Phase II SBIR contract with Johnson in January 2004, to build extremely strong and light hierarchical carbon nanotube-<span class=\"highlight\">composite</span> materials for NASA applications. Based on the successful results of the Phase I Johnson SBIR contract, Zyvex started offering solubilized carbon nanotubes, known commercially as NanoSolve, on its Web site in September 2003. Exactly a year later, in the midst of the Phase II SBIR work, Easton Sports announced the use of Zyvex carbon nanotube technology in its new line of bicycle parts.

Through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract from NASA&apos;s Marshall Space Flight Center, Science Research Laboratory, Inc., created the in situ e-beam curing technique, which uses a low-energy electron beam gun to cure various <span class=\"highlight\">composite</span> materials. One important benefit is the technique&apos;s utilization of room temperature curing, which lessens the chance of mismatching the thermal expansion coefficients of different materials. For instance, metals and composites will expand at different rates when heated, but the low-energy e-beam gun reduces the expansion differential. Using a low-energy gun also results in less x-ray shielding, significantly reduced capital costs, reduced facility space, and increased processing capabilities for larger parts. However, using a low-energy gun also means that each tape layer is treated individually because the gun can penetrate only one layer at a time. The e-beam gun emits lower energy x-rays, which are more easily shielded than those emitted by previous guns. The low-energy system is relatively portable due to its light weight and small size. The gun weighs about 70 pounds and can be easily mounted on a robotic arm or an ATP head.",

The ISC-200 is a pin-on-disk type of tribometer, functioning like a record player and creating a wear groove on the disk, with variables of speed and load. The system can measure the coefficient of friction, the wear behavior between materials, and the integrity of thin films or coatings. Applications include measuring wear on contact lenses and engine parts and testing disk drives.",

      "Many manufacturers of loudspeakers are now using a magnetic liquid cooling agent known as ferrofluid. Commercialized by Ferrofluids Corporation, ferrofluid is a liquid material in which sub-microscopic particles of iron oxide are permanently suspended. Injected into the voice coil segment of speaker system, magnetic liquid serves as superior heat transfer medium for cooling the voice coil, thus substantially increasing the system&apos;s ability to handle higher power levels and decreasing chance of speaker failure. Ferrofluid offers several additional advantages which add up to improved speaker performance, lower manufacturing costs and fewer rejects.",

Varian Microwave Power Tube Products, which has since become Communications and Power Industries, and Lewis combined the MDC and the klystron, resulting in a product which increases efficiency by recovering some of the residual energy that normally would be lost as heat.

After some key adjustments, the mini-dome lens array was flown as part of the U.S. Air Force/NASA Photovoltaic Array Space Power Plus Diagnostics (PASP Plus) flight experiment in 1994. Due to their three-dimensional shape, the mini-dome lenses entailed construction by a batch molding process, which is naturally more costly than a continuous process. To overcome this disadvantage and meet the requirement for precise solar pointing in two axes, ENTECH started developing solar concentrator arrays for space using a line-focus lens that can be mass-produced by a continuous process.

As a result of this meeting, Microcide was welcomed to join the NASA Food Technology for Commercial Space Center as an affiliate partner, with sponsorship from GMCI. As an affiliate partner, the company interacted with personnel from Johnson Space Center and learned that there was a need for a safe and non-toxic, biodegradable, microbicidal product to disinfect fresh fruit and vegetables for Space Shuttle crews. Microcide developed PRO-SAN, a technology comprised of safe sanitizing agents that could possibly be used as a disinfectant. A NASA-commissioned study proved the potential of PRO-SAN as a safe, stable, and biodegradable product for use in space; however, at the time, it was only available as a concentrated powder and a ready-to-use liquid. The powder is difficult to handle in zero gravity and the use of liquid presents increased payloads for flights. NASA and Microcide decided that the alternative would be to have the PRO-SAN powder concentrate available as a water-soluble package. Once this package is dropped in water, it can be stirred until it dissolves, creating a ready-to-use sanitizer. Based on this research, Microcide has perfected a food-grade soluble packaging design for use on Earth. A ready-made spray bottle formula is also available.",

The microspheres are now the key component for IST&apos;s novel plasma displays, since they can be made into a variety of contours and shapes without distorting the image. The spheres, which can be applied to both flexible and rigid panels, form the basis of an addressable pixel element-a Plasma-sphere display.

      "Paper-Thin Plastic Film Soaks Up Sun to Create Solar Energy",
      "In November 1989, Glenn Research Center awarded Iowa Thin Film Technologies with a $50,000 Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to research the potential for a lightweight and flexible thin film solar cell that uses amorphous silicon as a semiconductor source, for air and space applications. With this initial-phase funding, Iowa Thin Film Technologies demonstrated that development of the solar technology was viable and, thus, was awarded a $500,000 Phase II contract to move ahead with the manufacturing process, which then occurred over the course of 2 years. Funding from Glenn supported the research and development programs of Iowa Thin Film Technologies in the early years of the company and helped improve the company&apos;s process for depositing solar cells on rolls of thin, flexible plastic substrate. Presently, PowerFilm Solar, the solar division of PowerFilm, Inc. (the company previously known as Iowa Thin Film Technologies), manufactures and markets a differentiated line of next-generation, amorphous silicon, thin film solar panels that can easily and economically be integrated with consumer and military products. On the consumer end, the HR-1 Soltronix Solar Rechargeable AM/FM Headphone Radio, features a breakthrough combination of PowerFilm solar technology and premium sound. It automatically recharges itself when in sunlight, even while the user is listening to it. It will even recharge under interior house lighting or on cloudy or rainy days, albeit at a much slower rate. In military applications, PowerFilm Solar is providing solar tents to help meet the Army&apos;s growing demand for rapid-response rates and portable, remote power, while eliminating the need for noisy generators, spare batteries, and excessive fuel storage.",

      "Cryogenic Cooling for Myriad Applications—A STAR Is Born!",
      "Cryogenics, the science of generating extremely low temperatures, has wide applicability throughout NASA. In the late 1980s, NASA wanted a compact linear alternator/motor with reduced size and mass, as well as high efficiency, that had unlimited service life for use in a thermally driven power generator for space power applications. Prior development work with free-piston Stirling converters (a Stirling engine integrated with a linear actuator that produces electrical power output) had shown the promise of that technology for high-power space applications. A dual use for terrestrial applications exists for compact Stirling converters for onsite combined heat-and-power units.NASA entered into a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Clever Fellows Innovation Consortium, Inc. (CFIC), of Troy, New York, through Glenn Research Center, to develop a lighter, more robust linear alternator based on CFIC&apos;s novel STAR architecture. This resulted in a 15-kilowatt prototype alternator for NASA&apos;s Space Power Research Engine (SPRE) that reduced overall Stirling converter mass by 21 percent. The work accomplished through this partnership was later extended to a line of linear alternators and motors, used mainly in cryogenic refrigerators that are marketed by Qdrive, formed in 2001 as the cryogenic cooler development and manufacturing arm of CFIC. Qdrive&apos;s acoustic Stirling cryocooler line is now the industry&apos;s widest capacity range of unitary coolers, with 77 Kelvin capacities from 10 watts to over a kilowatt.",

      "Atomic oxygen&apos;s unique characteristic of oxidizing primarily hydrogen, carbon, and hydrocarbon polymers at surface levels has been applied in the restoration of artwork, detection of document forgeries, and removal of bacterial contaminants from surgical implants. The Electro-Physics Branch at Glenn Research Center built on corrosion studies of long-duration coatings for use in space, and applied atomic oxygen&apos;s selectivity to instances where elements need to be removed from a surface. Atomic oxygen is able to remove organic compounds high in carbon (mostly soot) from fire-damaged artworks without causing a shift in the paint color. First successfully tested on oil paintings, the team then applied the restoration technique to acrylics, watercolors, and ink. The successful art restoration process was well-publicized, and soon a multinational, nonprofit professional organization dedicated to the art of forensic analysis of documents had successfully applied this process in the field of forgery detection. The gas has biomedical applications as well-Atomic Oxygen technology can be used to decontaminate orthopedic surgical hip and knee implants prior to surgery, and additional collaborative research between the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and the Glenn team shows that this gas&apos;s roughening of surfaces improves cell adhesion, which is important for the development of new drugs.",

Having developed and commercialized the product, named Nurtigras, the company is now marketing it through its subsidiary, H.F. Food Technologies Inc. The Nutrigras fat substitute is available in liquid, gel, or dry form and can be easily customized to the specific needs of the food manufacturer. It is primarily intended for use as a partial replacement for animal fat in beef patties and other normally high-fat meat products, and can also be used in soups, sauces, bakery items, and desserts. In addition to the nutritional benefits, the fat replacement costs less than the food it replaces, and as such can help manufacturers reduce material costs. In precooked products, Nutrigras can increase moisture content and thereby increase product yield. The company has been able to repay the help provided by NASA by contributing to the Space Agency&apos;s astronaut diet-the Nutrigras fat substitute can be used as a flavor enhancer and shelf-life extender for food on the ISS.",

The test rig provides accelerated fatigue life testing for standard spur gears at speeds of up to 10,000 rotations per minute. The test rig enables engineers to investigate the effects of materials, heat treat, shot peen, lubricants, and other factors on the gear&apos;s performance. QuesTek Innovations LLC, based in Evanston, Illinois, recently developed a carburized, martensitic gear steel with an ultra-hard case using its computational design methodology, but needed to verify surface fatigue, lifecycle performance, and overall reliability. The Battelle Memorial Institute introduced the company to researchers at Glenn&apos;s Mechanical Components Branch and facilitated a partnership allowing researchers at the NASA Center to conduct spur gear fatigue testing for the company. Testing revealed that QuesTek&apos;s gear steel outperforms the current state-of-the-art alloys used for aviation gears in contact fatigue by almost 300 percent. With the confidence and credibility provided by the NASA testing, QuesTek is commercializing two new steel alloys. Uses for this new class of steel are limitless in areas that demand exceptional strength for high throughput applications.",

This NASA-supported cryostat development played a key part in the development of more portable high-purity geranium gamma-ray detectors. Such are necessary to discern between the radionuclides in medical, fuel, <span class=\"highlight\">weapon</span>, and waste materials. The outcome of the SBIR project is a cryostat that can cool gamma-ray detectors, without vibration, using compressed gas that can be stored compactly and indefinitely in a standby mode. General Pneumatics also produces custom J-T cryostats for other government, commercial and medical applications.",

EPRI is a non-profit organization that manages research and development for some 600 electric utility member companies. For the plasma melter program, EPRI enlisted as co-sponsors Westinghouse Electric&apos;s Environmental Systems and Services Division, General Motors Corporation, and Modern Equipment Company, supplier of equipment and services to the foundry industry. General Motor&apos;s plasma melter, first in the U.S., is an advanced <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> system designed to improve the efficiency of coke-burning cupolas that melt iron to produce automotive castings. The key elements are six Westinghouse plasma torches. Electrically-powered plasma torch creates an ionized gas that superheats air entering the cupola to 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That great heat, three times higher than that attainable by oil or natural gas systems, is the key to making iron cheaper, cleaner, and faster. System offers an environmental bonus in reduced cupola emissions. Plasma torches increase GM&apos;s electric bill at Defiance, but that cost is more than compensated by the savings in charge material.",

The company developed risk management software to calculate real-time service life evaluations and cumulative fatigue using rain-flow analysis techniques. By calculating total fatigue based on the logged history of real-time strain measurements, the system can perform predictive failure analysis in order to determine which riser sections need to be replaced. As a result, costly repair and downtime are reduced.",

      "<span class=\"highlight\">Technology</span> and medicine forged a bond in 1986 when a group of dedicated NASA scientists, University of Southern California medical professors, and a Dutch cardiologist joined forces to prevent heart attacks, using ultrasound images of astronauts&apos; blood-flow patterns and the supercomputer depended upon to orchestrate the Star Wars&quot; Strategic Defense Initiative. With assistance from NASA&apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory the system for capturing images of blood flow from ultrasound images of astronauts became more streamlined allowing for the development of what the technique is today. The proven reliability portability and accessibility of ultrasound set the stage for the major medical breakthrough known as CardioZoneT a nonradiation nonchemical safe and painless scan of the carotid arteries that is processed and computer-analyzed through proprietary software <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span>. According to the provider of CardioZone IMTHeartScan Inc. the cardiac-testing <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> is the only noninvasive procedure available for identifying fatty deposits called soft plaques. CardioZone is also more cost-effective than other diagnostic tests intended to detect atherosclerosis. The CardioZone <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> has saved the lives of countless individuals. *Product name changed to CardioZoneR in Oct. 2004.&quot;",

Baxter Healthcare added a polyimide coating which seals and ties down any loose fibers providing greater durability. Stress points along seams have been minimized to make the garment almost tearproof. Micro-Clean 212 garments are individually packaged and disposable.&quot;",

(Self Mastery and Regulation Training) BrainGames system, an interactive, at-home training tool that is completely compatible with off-the-shelf Sony PlaystionR video games, including such popular titles as Gran Turismo,R Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater,T and Spyro the Dragon.T The S.M.A.R.T. BrainGames product uses electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback to make a video game respond to the activity of the player&apos;s body and brain. Signals from sensors attached to the player&apos;s head and body are fed through a signal-processing unit, and then to a video game controller. As the player&apos;s brainwaves come closer to an optimal state of attention, the video game&apos;s controller becomes easier to control. On the contrary, if a player becomes bored or distracted, the brainwaves stray from the desired stress-free pattern, and controlling the game becomes more difficult. This encourages the player to continue producing optimal patterns or signals to succeed at the game.",

The company&apos;s systems based on the Apollo-era <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> electronically release copper and silver ions into the water to destroy bacteria and algae-which are then filtered out. Unlike chlorine, the ions do not dissipate from heat and sunlight, therefore they are capable of providing a very stable sanitizer residual. The ionization <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> substantially reduces the demand for chlorine so that fewer chloramines are formed and fewer chemicals are consumed. This cuts down on undesirable side effects realized in swimming pool environments, such as burning eyes, odor, and bleached or dry skin and hair. Furthermore, the ions pose no health risks.",

      "From 1993 to 1997, Biolog received Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts work with NASA in developing two technologies that are now in use by Biolog customers worldwide. The first <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span>, based on the company&apos;s pre-existing assay kits, was a process created to monitor populations of microbes. NASA was interested in using this process as a way of monitoring the health of hydroponic crops that would be grown in space during future manned missions to Mars. The second <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> was an instrumented system that would allow automated monitoring of Biolog&apos;s assay kits for NASA&apos;s purposes. Together, these innovations intended to provide NASA with better means of growing food in space and avoiding a catastrophic crop failure during long-term space travel. Biolog went on to extend the technologies it developed with the SBIR assistance to bring two novel and important cell-testing technologies to market: the Phenotype MicroArray and the OmniLog System. Biolog&apos;s Phenotype MicroArray <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> is complementary to DNA microarrays and proteomic technologies, which allow scientists to detect changes in levels of genes or proteins that direct most cellular functions. In the field of drug discovery, it allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive picture of a drug&apos;s effect on a specific cell. Incubation and recording of phenotypic data gathered from the Phenotype MicroArray are performed by the OmniLog PM System, an integrated system of cellular assays, instrumentation, and bioinformatics software. Just as it automatically monitored assay kits for NASA, the OmniLog <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> monitors thousands of phenotypes simultaneously. Another version of the OmniLog product, called the OmniLog ID System, can be paired with Biolog&apos;s microbial-identification kits to easily and efficiently identify over 2,000 species of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and fungi.",

      "Since 1981, SSME faults have caused 23 scrubbed launches and 29 percent of total Space Shuttle downtime, according to a compilation of analysis reports. The most serious cases typically occur in the last few seconds before ignition; a launch scrub that late in the countdown usually means a period of investigation of a month or more. In 2002, NASA&apos;s Kennedy Space Center, the Florida Institute of <span class=\"highlight\">Technology</span>, and Interface &amp; Control Systems, Inc., worked together to attack this problem by creating a system that could automate the detection of mechanical failures in the SSMEs&apos; fuel control valves.

SensorMiner is a time-series data-mining tool that uses past performance data to build human-readable models for real-time fault detection. The system learns&quot; from the past performance data develops a &quot;signature&quot; for nominal operation and automatically generates a fault-monitoring system. Conventional <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> has made this process both a labor-intensive and error-prone task that is often misunderstood even by experts according to Interface &amp; Control Systems.

The material also needed to withstand millions of pounds of pressure per inch of bending without twisting. One result of the work was the discovery of the useful properties of radiant barrier material. The radiant barrier material reflected more than 95 percent of the radiant energy while tiny holes in the fabric allowed moisture to escape and longer heat waves to get through.

      "A new self-adjusting, retractable pin tool for friction stir welding is now used in the manufacturing of components for NASA Space Shuttles. Friction stir welding is a process that makes straight-line welds without bringing the parent material to a liquid state. This is accomplished through high-speed rotation, which generates frictional heat between the welding tool and the piece being welded. This heat causes the material to soften to the point of plasticity without allowing it to melt. The plasticized material is then transferred from the front edge of the welding tool to the trail edge, where it joins the pieces being welded. However, a major flaw of this method is its reliance on a single-piece pin tool. The weld is left unfinished and a hole remains where the pin was inserted. The hole must be covered with a rivet in order to preserve the integrity of the weld. The NASA-developed pin tool, however, eliminates the need for this finishing step, as its retraction allows continuous rewelding at lesser depths, until the hole is completely closed.  With this NASA <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span>, welding of higher strength alloys, as well as non-planer and variable thickness structures can be achieved. Applications are projected for the defense industry, and according to an engineer from Marshall, the <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> could be used to weld shut radioactive waste canisters.",

      "In 1985, the Egyptian Antiques Organization (EAO) asked Dr. Farouk El-Baz whether it would be possible to examine and sample the second chamber of the subterranean chamber carved in the bedrock near the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Giza, Egypt, without admitting people, air or contaminants. He felt it could by applying space <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> to the task. The initial contact led to a two year project which he organized and headed a team, co-sponsored by EAO and the National Geographic Society (NGS), to apply space <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> in an effort to examine and photograph the Giza Chamber. The NGS photographic division modified and tested a remotely controlled video system and a 35-millimeter camera, and developed a lighting system that would not elevate the chamber temperature. Still needed was a drill to cut through the limestone cap without using lubricants or cooling fluids that might contaminate the chamber, and an airlock that would admit the drill shaft and photo equipment but not the air. Bob Mooresfrom Black &amp; Decker Corporation tailored a new drill to the Giza exploration. The drill bit broke through into the chamber at a depth of 63 inches, a stainless steel tube was lowered through the airlock to take samples of the chamber air at several levels. The video camera sent images from the chamber revealing that there was a disassembled royal boat that had been there since the 26th century B.C. After recording the chamber&apos;s contents on film and tape, the team removed the airlock and replaced it with a seal fitted with sensors that would periodically monitor chamber temperature and humidity indefinitely.",

Almost 60,000 books, some irreplaceable, were completely soaked by tons of water. Temple&apos;s insurance company felt that the space vacuum chamber, originally used by Lunar Land Rover and Nimbus Weather Satellite could be effectively employed as a dryout tank. When books are in place and vault-like door secured, chamber pressure is reduced to spacelike conditions 1/100th of an atmosphere promoting evaporation of water. As water evaporates, it freezes in the near vacuum.  After 24 hours, pressure is increased to break the vacuum. Then hot freon gas is introduced into chamber causing ice to melt, water is drained off through an opening in the chamber. This process is repeated until damaged materials are thoroughly dry.",

      "With assistance from NASA&apos;s Marshall Space Flight Center, a new breed of artificial intelligence-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) for technical training and complex problem-solving has hit the market to provide students and trainees with the decision-making skills necessary to succeed to the next level. The Task Tutor ToolkitT (T3), developed by Stottler Henke Associates, Inc., of San Mateo, California, is a generic tutoring system shell and scenario authoring tool that emulates expert instructors and lowers the cost and difficulty of creating scenario-based ITS for technical training. The functionality of Stottler Henke Associates&apos; T3 far exceeds that of traditional computer-based training systems, which test factual recall and narrow skills by prompting students to answer multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions. The T3, on the contrary, lets students assess situations, generate solutions, make decisions, and carry out actions in realistically complex scenarios. The tutoring <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> was developed from 1997 to 2002, under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Marshall, to address NASA&apos;s need for rapid deployment of scenario-based tutoring systems.",

Reeves in 1958 for the express purpose of working with NASA and the U.S. Air Force on systems to monitor the vital signs of astronauts in space. As a prime contractor to NASA for the Gemini Program, the company manufactured and delivered prototypes of miniaturized signal conditioners to measure astronauts&apos; temperature, respiration, and cardiac activity. It went on to further expand its knowledge of monitoring and maintaining health in space, and then brought it down to Earth, to dramatically change the course of patient monitoring in the field of health care. Today, the company&apos;s Intesys Clinical Suite enables ubiquitous access to patient information. One component of this suite is the Vital Signs Viewer, which allows physicians to see a patient&apos;s live waveforms remotely from any networked personal computer located outside of a hospital, such as a laptop set up in a physician&apos;s offsite office or home. Another component is the Clinical Event Interface, which advises caregivers of patient status or patient alarms, via advanced communication devices. In addition, Spacelabs Medical&apos;s WinDNA software provides hospital staff access to and interaction with medicine administration records, laboratory test results, any type of electronic report or chart located in other areas of a hospital, and any Windows program on a hospital&apos;s network. By allowing seamless data acquisition and exchange across an entire health care organization, this <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> improves overall efficiency and prevents caregivers from having to leave a patient&apos;s side to obtain information that is physically located somewhere else.",

      "To maintain the Aquarius underwater research facility, the International Space Station, and the space shuttle as safe, healthy living/research habitats for its personnel-while keeping costs in mind-NASA, in 1997, recruited the help of Invocon, Inc., to develop wireless sensor <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> that monitors and measures various environmental and structural parameters inside these facilities. This project, funded through a Johnson Space Center Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, focused on developing wireless sensors to help cut back on the integration costs associated with wired sensors. It included the conceptual design, fabrication, and demonstration of a battery-powered, miniature, wireless temperature sensor. NASA and Invocon agreed to take Invocon&apos;s existing wireless network communication system and combine it with various microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. The innovation consisted of a PC interface unit, a graphical user interface, and multiple wireless sensors that are each equivalent in size to a stack of five quarters. The resulting sensor system has flown and operated successfully on numerous space shuttle missions, and further use is being investigated for monitoring carbon dioxide concentrations onboard the ISS, in the crew&apos;s sleeping quarters, and in regions of reduced airflow. The commercial offspring is a wireless, remote, low-power, carbon dioxide data-acquisition system for near-static sensing and recording applications. Invocon has also spun off several next-generation&quot; MicroWIS products that are configured for applications other than carbon dioxide sensing. The latest of these products,  the MicroWIS-XG,  can be used for sensing environmental,  temperature,  strain,  and pressure parameters,  for example. In the area of construction,  one of these next-generation systems was used to monitor external grout pressure during the building of three tunnels in the Netherlands.",

      "To work in NASA&apos;s Mission Control Center and share in the excitement of seeing the very first close-up images of Saturn being piped back to Earth (from the Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1979) is not a sensation that most high school students get to experience. However, as part of an internship in NASA&apos;s Space Biology Program, Mary M. Yang had the opportunity to do just that. This rewarding experience of working with NASA turned out to be the first of several for Yang, who, as a young student, was fascinated with planetary imaging and remote sensing observations. Following high school, she worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, developing sensors for NASA, and attended the University of California, Berkeley. Yang then went on to pursue a doctorate in geology at Princeton University, where her thesis covered spectroscopy and data analysis of minerals and solutions-themes she also encountered in her work for NASA. After completing her doctorate, Yang joined the research laboratory of Douglas Youvan, then a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of <span class=\"highlight\">Technology</span>. Youvan and Yang developed prototype imaging spectrophotometers that enabled them to acquire spectra directly from bacterial colonies growing on the surface of a Petri plate. This type of imaging instrument analyzes a combination of spatial and spectral information so that spectra can be obtained for each feature in an image. Analyses of this kind were initially applied by NASA to rather large scenes, such as planetary and remote sensing studies. In 1991, Yang and Youvan founded KAIROS (now KAIROS Scientific, Inc.) to extend Yang&apos;s NASA know-how plus the imaging spectrophotometers initially developed for laboratory-based photosynthesis studies, to the fields of materials science, health, and biotechnology. Today, KAIROS Scientific develops molecular biology methods, instrumentation, and computer algorithms to create solutions for a host of clients that includes multinational specialty chemical companies, large pharmaceutical firms, and academic laboratories.",

      "In 1997, AgriHouse, Inc. (d.b.a. Aeroponics International), a leading agri-biology company, united with NASA and BioServe Space Technologies, a non-profit, NASA-sponsored partnership research center, to design a soil-less plant-growth experiment to be performed in microgravity, aboard the Mir space station. This experiment aimed to gauge the effectiveness of a non-pesticide solution on the immune responses of bean plants. In essence, the research consortium was looking for a means of keeping plants free from infection, without having to rely on the use of pesticides. This research, combined with follow-on grants from NASA, has helped Berthoud, Colorado-based AgriHouse gain credibility in the commercial marketplace with related <span class=\"highlight\">technology</span> and gross the capital necessary to conduct further research in a new-age field known as bio-pharming. One of the company&apos;s products is the Genesis Series V aeroponic system. With this rapid-growth system, plants can be started from cuttings taken from an already-mature plant by placing them in the openings on top of a growing chamber. The stems are suspended in this chamber. If starting with seeds, they can be placed on specially designed mesh holders that are inside of the chamber. For both the cuttings and the seeds, the resulting plants rapidly develop root systems and grow in an enclosed, air-based environment, made moist by a hydro-atomized, nutrient-rich spray that is released in timed intervals by a microcomputer and finely misted onto the growth subjects. This clean, sterile environment greatly reduces the chances of spreading plant disease and infection that is commonly associated with other growing media. Once roots are developed, the plants can be easily removed for transplanting into any type of media without experiencing transplant shock or setback to normal growth. According to AgriHouse, growers choosing to employ the aeroponics method can reduce water usage by 98 percent, fertilizer usage by 60 percent, and pesticide usage by 100 percent, all while maximizing their crop yields by 45 to 75 percent. Another product derived from NASA research, BEYOND eliminates the need for pesticides; promotes faster seed germination; increases the survival rate of seeds; revives sick or infected plants; increases growth and yields; adds natural nitrogen to soil-based flora; is 100-percent biodegradable; and has an indefinite shelf life.",

On the commercial end, Amnis has implemented the process in ImageStream, combining high-resolution microscopy and flow cytometry in a single instrument, giving researchers the power to conduct quantitative analyses of individual cells and cell populations at the same time, in the same experiment. ImageStream is also built for many other applications, including cell signaling and pathway analysis; classification and characterization of peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations; quantitative morphology; apoptosis (cell death) assays; gene expression analysis; analysis of cell conjugates; molecular distribution; and receptor mapping and distribution.

The Accommotrac system is an optical/electronic system used by a doctor as an aid in teaching a patient how to contract and relax the ciliary body, the focusing muscle. The key is biofeedback, wherein the patient learns to control a bodily process or function he is not normally aware of.

      "The discovery that human error has caused many more airline crashes than mechanical malfunctions led to an increased emphasis on teamwork and coordination in airline flight training programs. Human factors research at Ames Research Center has produced two crew training programs directed toward more effective operations. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) defines areas like decision making, workload distribution, communication skills, etc. as essential in addressing human error problems. In 1979, a workshop led to the implementation of the CRM program by United Airlines, and later other airlines. In Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT), crews fly missions in realistic simulators while instructors induce emergency situations requiring crew coordination. This is followed by a self critique. Ames Research Center continues its involvement with these programs.",

The problem stemmed from a lack of signal isolation of the analog input cards, which made the inputs vulnerable to interference from storms and machinery. Electronic technician Bob Ervolino read an article in Tech Briefs describing an Ames Research Center solution to a similar problem. He studied the Technical Support Package and contacted the vendor; the information saved the Water Division more than 50 percent of the cost of commercial isolators.",

Wessex received a license for PCCM in 1996 and initially applied it to building materials for firewall applications. Through further testing and experimentation, however, the company would eventually come to learn the true potential of PCCM, leading to longer-lasting materials, greater energy conservation and fuel efficiency, increased productivity, and significantly reduced operating costs for numerous U.S. businesses. Known commercially as Emisshield,T Wessex&apos;s PCCM product mirrors NASA&apos;s original protective coating in that it provides increased hemispherical&quot; emissivity-the ability to absorb energy and reradiate it to a cooler surface body or atmosphere. Like PCCM Emisshield can be reused and repeatedly cycled between severe extremes of subzero temperatures and temperatures over 3000 ?F without ever damaging the protective coating or the underlying material. With each use the coating&apos;s molecular structure is rearranged to create a stronger bond between the coating and the underlying material and an even greater level of thermal protection.

Sculley&apos;s experience as a virtual reality and Mars specialist and Brooks&apos;s experience creating NASA public access programs were significant to the company&apos;s success. In addition to the inspiration and knowledge acquired while employed by NASA, the founders gained assistance from the Agency in the form of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts.  All of this led to the development of Inside NASA a software product that provides virtual tours of NASA&apos;s field centers. Inside NASA&quot; also steps well outside of the NASA field centers&apos; front doors to give its audience an adventurous yet informative panoramic look at some of the heavenly bodies above. These images explore the landscape of the Moon as seen from the Apollo 17 lunar rover; the Martian surface as seen from the Viking 2 lander; and the red spot of Jupiter as seen from the planet&apos;s Jovian moon Europa via the Galileo orbiter.&quot;",

      "A team of engineers at Ames Research Center invented an environmentally friendly anti-icing fluid to keep hazardous ice from building up on airplane wings. The typical approach to clearing off the ice is to use a deicing solution once the ice has built up. The fluid created by the Ames team, though, when applied to a dry surface, prevents the ice from even forming a surface bond, which saves deicing time and money, while also preventing excessive use of chemical solvents rivers, or bodies of water that support life. WorldSource, Inc., of Palm Desert, California, a developer and distributor of products for the consumer marketplace, is marketing the fluid as  Ice Free, a spray for automobile windshields that can provide protection down to 20 ?F.",

Under two SBIR contracts with Ames Research Center, Nanoptek Corp., based in Concord, Massachusetts, grew titania crystals with such surface tension that they became responsive to 29 percent of total sunlight. Nanoptek_s photocatalytic panels convert energy to stored hydrogen, representing the first electrolyzer to be competitive with batteries.",

There were two principal concerns: barring crumbs of food that might contaminate the spacecraft&apos;s atmosphere or float their way into sensitive instruments; and assuring absolute freedom from potentially catastrophic disease-producing bacteria and toxins. Pillsbury quickly solved the first concern, but the other part of the problem was not as easy. They found that with using standard methods, there was no way to be assured there would not be any bacteria. It was concluded that the only way to succeed was to establish control over the entire process, the raw materials, the processing environment and the people involved. Pillsbury developed the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept. The HACCP is designed to prevent food safety problems rather than to catch them after they have occurred. Three other government agencies are taking preliminary steps toward extending HACCP to meat/poultry and seafood inspection operations. Today, Pillsbury plants are still operating under HACCP.",

      "A Natural Way to Stay Sweet",
      "Tagatose, a sugar that appears in nature in small quantities, offers a low-calorie, all-natural alternative to table sugar and artificial sweeteners. It began its unusual journey to the commercial market when Dr. Gilbert V. Levin invented a life detection experiment to place aboard NASA&apos;s Mars Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers. The experiment involved using radiation-laced nutrients to determine the presence of microbial life in Martian soil samples. In selecting the nutrients for the experiment, Levin explored different forms of sugar. His work ultimately led to tagatose, which proved its advantages as an alternative for regular sugar. Tagatose is 92 percent as sweet at table sugar and can be used as a one-to-one sugar replacement, allowing it to be used in recipes for baked goods. Tagatose also browns like regular sugar during baking, and does not have an aftertaste like some high-intensity sweeteners. It does not cause cavities or promote tooth decay, and provides a safe sweetener for diabetics. Arla Foods Ingredients sells tagatose to food and beverage manufacturers under the name Gaio-Tagatose.R Spherix, Inc. has launched Naturlose,T a non-food version of the sugar, to improve the taste of products such as throat lozenges and cough syrup.   Gaio-TagatoseR is a registered trademark of Arla Foods Ingredients. NaturloseT is a trademark of Spherix, Inc.",

      "NASA teamed up with NAVSYS Corporation to address the unreliability of GPS surveying in urban environments and the amount of time it took to collect large quantities of data for geographic information systems. Under a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, NAVSYS developed a tightly-coupled GPS/inertial/video-mapping system that could add precise position and attitude metadata to digital camera images. This system could allow the digital images to be post-processed and the coordinates of objects of interest to be collected, plus high-accuracy GPS/inertial integration algorithms could continue mapping operations through short GPS dropouts, without noticeable performance degradation. The original system developed for NASA was a van-based unit. NAVSYS took this system and developed a smaller airborne version of the product, termed GI-Eye, which was then used to collect aerial mapping data for commercial and <span class=\"highlight\">military</span> applications.",

Owens Corning had been experimenting with an ultrafine pure glass finer yarn called Beta. The yarn was woven into a fabric, coated with Teflon and tailored for astronaut wear. SOM decided upon an open-sided, tented-roof structure with white Fiberglas fabric, coated with Teflon on both sides that reflects 75 percent of the solar radiation reaching the roof, thus helping to curb the intense heat.",

It is alive and well today in the form of eyewear that caters to the needs of any lifestyle. Over the past few years, SunTiger, now doing business as Eagle Eyes Optics, has extended its product line to over 40 styles of sunglasses. As the brand expanded, so did the product categories. Eagles Eyes has spent the last couple of years reviewing advancements in optical research. The results of this research can now be enjoyed by consumers seeking to improve their vision in environments with poor lighting. The latest product is called StimuLights. Designed specifically for low-light environments, StimuLights can be worn outdoors while driving in hazy, foggy, dusk and dawn conditions and indoors while working on computers under fluorescent lights or watching television or reading in dimly lit areas. Special cut-on and cut-off filters in the lenses relax the eyes and provide improved clarity, definition, and color contrast under these conditions. The filters cut on to let the eyes receive useful, vision-enhancing red, yellow, and green light rays and cut off to prevent blue and violet light from entering and focusing on the retina.

      "By adopting a high-strength, wear-resistant aluminum alloy from NASA for its latest product line, Bombardier Recreational Products Inc., has created a boater&apos;s dream: the first outboard motor engine that will not require oil changes, winterization, spring tune-ups, or scheduled maintenance for 3 years of normal recreational use. Not only is the new E-TECT engine maintenance-free from such tedious upkeep responsibilities, its piston design successfully reduces the so-called slapping&quot; sound that occurs when pistons slide up and down in the engine&apos;s cylinder. The NASA alloy greatly improves piston durability because it is 2.5 times stronger than conventional cast aluminum pistons at high temperatures and can be produced with a material cost of less than $1 per pound. Engineers finalizing the product also saw environmental advantages from the alloy as it would help the new engine comply with the most stringent emissions standards in the United States.&quot;",

By employing solid-state pressure sensing transducers whose errors are automatically corrected by a microprocessor, it is capable of highly accurate pressure measurements.

The project called for three experiments that would fly onboard the Space Shuttle over the course of three separate missions. By unleashing contact lens materials to the microgravity settings of space, scientists from NASA and Paragon hoped to better understand how polymers-large molecules that make up plastics-are formed. Paragon&apos;s HDSR (hyperpurified delivery system) contact lenses are based on the unique technological advancements derived from the NASA experiments. HDS lenses are considered gas permeable, and therefore do not contain water, are resistant from deposits, and are less likely than soft contact lenses to harbor bacteria. The rigidity of gas permeable contact lenses also makes them easier to handle than soft lenses, plus they retain their shape over time to provide crisper vision. The HDS line eliminated bad&quot; silicones making the lenses extremely oxygen efficient. Paragon additionally leveraged what it learned from the Space Shuttle experiments to invent a contact lens made from HDS materials that non-surgically reshapes the cornea during sleep. .&quot;",

      "NASA&apos;s Johnson Space Center awarded Argonide Corporation a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to determine the feasibility of using the company&apos;s NanoCeramR fibers for purifying recycled space cabin water. Through the NASA partnership, Argonide developed a laboratory-size filter capable of removing greater than 99.9999 percent of bacteria and viruses from water at flow rates more than 200 times faster than virus-rated membranes that remove particles by sieving. The filter also removes greater than 99.96 percent of endotoxins. As a contaminant formed from the residue of destroyed bacteria, endotoxins can cause toxic shock and present a major concern in pharmaceutical products. Argonide supplies NanoCeram as laboratory-size filter discs and in the form of a syringe filter. These products provide the biotechnology and life science industries with fast, accurate, and cost-effective tools for separating proteins and other macromolecules. NanoCeram&apos;s key applications include sterilizing pharmaceuticals and medical serums; filtering DNA, RNA, and endotoxins; and immobilizing bacteria and mammalian cells in biosynthesis. The filters are capable of sterilizing water from all microbiological pathogens, including biological warfare weapons.   NanoCeramR is a registered trademark of Argonide Corporation.",

Findings about how to use plants to improve indoor air quality have been published in dozens of NASA technical papers and in the book &quot;How to Grow Fresh Air: 50 Houseplants That Purify Your Home or Office.&quot; The book has now been translated into 12 languages and has been on the shelves of bookstores for nearly 10 years. A companion book &quot;Growing Clean Water: Nature&apos;s Solution to Water Pollution explains how plants can clean waste water. Other discoveries include that the more air that is allowed to circulate through the roots of the plants, the more effective they are at cleaning polluted air; and that plants play a psychological role in welfare in that people recover from illness faster in the presence of plants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWolverton Environmental is also working in partnership with Syracuse University, to engineer systems consisting of modular wicking filters tied into duct work and water supplies, essentially tying plant-based filters into heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Also, the company has recently begun to assess the ability of the EcoPlanter to remove formaldehyde from interior environments.

In the cell, microorganisms and rooted aquatic plants combine to absorb and digest wastewater pollutants, thereby converting sewage to relatively clean water. Raw waste water, after a period in the sewage lagoon, flows over a rock bed populated by microbes that digest nutrients and minerals from the sewage thus partially cleaning it.

Monsanto sold production rights for this material to Fire Safe Products (FSP). Durette is now used for a wide range of applications such as: sheets, attendants&apos; uniforms in hyperbaric chambers; crew&apos;s clothing, furniture and interior walls of diving chambers operated by the U.S. Navy and other oceanographic companies and research organizations. Pyrotect Safety Equipment, Minneapolis, MN produces Durette suits for auto racers, refuelers and crew chiefs from material supplied by FSP. FSP also manufactures Durette bags for filtering gases and dust from boilers, electric generators and similar systems. Durette bags are an alternative to other felted fiber capable of operating at high temperature that cost twice as much.",

      "Citrus growers have long used aerial photography to inventory the number of groves in production. A new development at Kennedy <span class=\"highlight\">Space</span> Center, aerial mapping of groves with color infrared (CIR) film, affords an important advance in grove management by detecting and locating unhealthy trees long before they could be detected by ground survey methods. Aerial CIR photography picks up light reflected from foliage--light not visible to the human eye--and enables differenciation between healthy and stressed&quot; (diseased) trees of a Florida orange/grapefruit grove. Computer aided photo interpretation techniques permit grading diseased trees lightly moderately or severely stressed or dead. Method of grove mapping has offered advantage to growers in early disease warning possible savings through water regulation and provision of a permanent record of grove growth patterns.&quot;",

Two programs are underway. The first transfers comprehensive risk management techniques and procedures which take the form of an instruction document that includes determining liquid-gas risks through engineering analysis and tests, controlling these risks by setting up redundant fail safe techniques, and establishing criteria calling for decisions that eliminate or accept certain risks. The second program prepares a liquid gas safety manual (the first of its kind).",

The Model 74000 detector incorporates a sensing circuit that detects UV radiation in a 100 degree conical field of view extending as far as 250 feet from the instrument. It operates in a bandwidth that makes it virtually blind&quot; to solar radiation while affording extremely high sensitivity to ultraviolet flame detection. A &quot;windowing&quot; technique accurately discriminates between background UV radiation and ultraviolet emitted from an actual flame hence the user is assured of no false alarms. Model 7410CP is a combination controller and annunciator panel designed to monitor and control as many as 24 flame detectors.  *Model 74000 is no longer being manufactured.&quot;",
